   platform selection   CRM + workflows       training + pilot      partner support setup
```

**This project's flow:**
- Full 4-phase. Medium strategy (requirements + platform selection), heavy engineering (PRM config, CRM sync, workflow builds), standard enablement (internal + partner training), standard handoff.
- Some customers may compress Phase 1 if they have already selected a PRM platform and documented requirements.
- Phase 2 is the heaviest — portal configuration, deal registration workflows, CRM integration, and reporting all require significant technical effort.

| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Partner-Sourced        | Opportunity originated by a partner where no prior sales engagement existed                                  |
| Partner-Influenced     | Opportunity where a partner contributed to progression but did not originate it                              |
| Deal Registration      | Formal submission by a partner claiming a sales opportunity for protection and commission eligibility         |
| Partner Tier           | Classification level (e.g., Bronze/Silver/Gold) based on performance, certifications, or revenue thresholds |
| Referral Partner       | Partner who refers leads/opportunities in exchange for a referral fee                                        |
| Reseller Partner       | Partner who sells and delivers the product directly, taking a margin                                         |
| Technology Partner     | Partner whose product integrates with the client's product for mutual benefit                                |
| PRM                    | Partner Relationship Management — the platform used to manage partner programs                               |

| Attribution Model      | Rules determining how partner contribution to revenue is credited and tracked                                 |

---

## Common Gotchas

- Selecting PRM platform before documenting requirements → Score platforms against documented workflows, not demos
- One-way CRM sync causing stale data and broken trust → Require native bidirectional sync as a selection criterion; test thoroughly before go-live
- Partner portal UX ignored in favor of internal reporting needs → Include partner feedback in requirements; pilot with engaged partners; simplify deal registration to under 2 minutes [1]
- Rushing to go-live without enablement → Plan 2-3 weeks for internal + partner training before full launch; create role-specific guides; set up partner support channel first
- Territory/conflict detection rules not configured → Build conflict detection before enabling deal registration; test with sample deals that should trigger conflicts
- Commission structure not mapped before launch → Document all commission rules and integrate payment tracking before partner onboarding

## Phase 1: Strategy

> **Goal:** Get stakeholder sign-off on partner program requirements, PRM platform selection, and integration scope.
>
> **Output:** Requirements Matrix + Platform Selection + Definition Alignment Document (signed off by stakeholders).

### 1a. Pre-Kickoff

> Two parallel tracks run before the kickoff call.

#### Track A: Customer Homework

**What we send:**

| Item                          | Purpose                                              | Format             |

## Phase 2: Engineering

> **Goal:** Configure and test the PRM platform with CRM integration based on the approved strategic package.
>
> **Output:** Fully configured PRM platform with CRM sync, automated workflows, and dashboards — tested and customer-approved.

This project is **engineering-heavy** — PRM configuration, CRM integration, workflow automation, and dashboard builds are the core of the engagement.

### Sub-Phases

```
2a Tech Spec → 2b Engineering Handoff → 2c Build → 2d Test
```

---

### 2a. Tech Spec

> **Purpose:** Translate the strategic package into technical specifications for PRM configuration and CRM integration.

**Input:** Signed-off requirements matrix, platform selection, Definition Alignment Document

**Output:** Draft tech spec containing:

- **PRM Platform Configuration**: Admin settings, branding, security (SSO/MFA), role-based permissions
- **Partner Program Config**: Tier structure, qualification criteria, program-specific settings, automated tier upgrade/downgrade rules
- **Onboarding Workflow**: Application form fields, approval logic (auto-approve tier 1, manual tier 2+), welcome emails, training modules, resource library
- **Deal Registration Workflow**: Submission form fields, approval routing (auto-approve under threshold, manager review for large deals), territory/conflict detection, expiration rules (90-day default), notifications
- **Lead Sharing Workflow**: Distribution rules (round-robin, territory, capacity), acceptance SLAs (48-hour default), status tracking, bidirectional submission forms
- **Attribution Configuration**: Partner-sourced vs. partner-influenced field mapping, attribution rules (first touch, multi-touch), influenced revenue tracking, validation rules
- **CRM Field Mapping**: Standard fields (company name, contact, deal stage, amount) + custom fields (partner tier, program type, attribution source), sync direction per field, sync frequency (real-time vs. batch)
- **Dashboard Specs**: Partner activity dashboard, pipeline dashboard, revenue dashboard, tier distribution reports, engagement scorecard, executive ROI reports

```

---

### 4a. Maintenance Schedule

> **Purpose:** Document what needs ongoing attention after the project is complete.

**Monthly Tasks:**

| Monthly Task                | What to Check                                         | Red Flag Threshold                          |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Partner Activity Audit      | Login rates, deal reg submissions, resource downloads  | Login rate drops below 50% of active partners |
| CRM Sync Health Check       | Sync error logs, data quality audit, field mapping drift | Any sync errors persisting >48 hours        |
| New Partner Onboarding Review | New partners going through onboarding flow smoothly   | Onboarding completion rate below 80%         |
| Deal Registration Throughput | Approval times, rejection rates, expiration volume    | Average approval time exceeds 48 hours       |

**Quarterly Tasks:**

| Quarterly Task                  | What to Review                                        | Action if Off-Track                        |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Full Partner Performance Review | Revenue by partner, tier distribution, engagement scores | Re-tier partners, adjust program benefits  |
| Attribution Accuracy Audit      | Partner-sourced vs. influenced accuracy, orphan deals  | Fix attribution rules, clean orphan records |
| Dashboard & Report Accuracy     | Data freshness, calculation correctness                | Update field mappings, fix broken reports   |
| Partner Program ROI Analysis    | Revenue vs. commissions/costs by program type          | Adjust commission rates, sunset low-ROI programs |

**After First Business Cycle (30-90 days post-launch):**

- Partner portal login rate: target >70% within 30 days
- Deal registration volume: target 2x baseline from manual process
- Partner-sourced pipeline: measure increase against pre-PRM baseline
- Attribution accuracy: target 95%+ (no orphan partner deals)
- Key question: Is the platform driving partner engagement and accurate revenue tracking?

**Refinement Triggers (when to re-engage):**

| Trigger                        | Threshold                                      | Response                                          |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Partner adoption declining     | Login rate drops >20% for 2+ consecutive months | Re-engage for partner re-training or UX improvements |
| Deal registration volume flat  | No increase after 60 days live                  | Audit registration flow friction, simplify process |
| Attribution accuracy degrading | Below 90% for any quarter                       | Re-audit CRM sync rules and attribution logic      |
| Partner churn increasing       | >10% partner churn in a quarter                 | Scope partner experience improvement project       |

**Every 6-12 Months:**

- Full PRM Configuration Review: Audit platform settings, workflows, and integrations for drift or new requirements
- Partner Program Redesign Assessment: Evaluate if tier structure, commission rates, and program types still fit business strategy

**Output:** Customer owns the PRM platform. Project formally complete.

---

### 4d. Project Close

> **Purpose:** Clean internal wrap-up + establish retention/expansion path.

#### Archive Checklist

- [ ] All project artifacts saved to proper location
- [ ] Handoff documentation complete
- [ ] Project status updated in tracking system
- [ ] Time/billing finalized
- [ ] Admin credentials transferred to client

#### Internal Debrief (Optional but Recommended)

- What went well?
- What would we do differently?
- Platform-specific learnings (integration quirks, configuration tips)
- Partner adoption insights (what drove engagement, what didn't)

#### Retention / Expansion

**Two paths based on engagement type:**

| Engagement Type               | Path                          |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Single Project**            | Upsell → Downsell → Retry     |
| **Multi-Project (Dedicated)** | Schedule Refinement Check-In  |

**Single Project Path:**

```
1. Upsell: Managed Services (ongoing partner program optimization, QBR support, new program launches)
   ↓ if no
2. Downsell: Another one-time project (e.g., attribution model, commission tracking, co-sell process)
   ↓ if yes
3. Retry retainer at end of next project cycle
```

**Multi-Project (Dedicated) Path:**

Schedule a refinement check-in at handoff (~90 days out) to review partner adoption rates, deal registration volume, and attribution accuracy — and determine if any adjustments are needed.

**Internal prep (2 weeks before check-in):**

| Step                | What Happens                                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. Get pinged       | System reminder: refinement check-in in 2 weeks        |
| 2. Review metrics   | Pull partner adoption data, deal reg volume, attribution accuracy |
| 3. Decide ownership | Can the ongoing team handle this check-in, or is SME needed? |
| 4. Prep materials   | If SME needed, brief them. Otherwise, prep talking points. |

**At the refinement check-in:**

- Review partner adoption against targets (70% login rate, 2x deal reg volume)
- Identify any adjustments needed (workflow changes, new program types, integration fixes)
- If minor: Ongoing team handles tweaks
- If major: Scope new project

**Output:** Project archived. Future revenue path established. Ready for next engagement.

### Key Industry Context

Partner ecosystems are a significant revenue driver for B2B SaaS companies. Organizations derive between 30-60% of their revenue from partnerships, and partners contribute 38.2% of SaaS application revenue on average [2][3]. Companies that incorporate partners into their sales strategies experience higher close rates and larger deal sizes, with partnerships cutting customer acquisition costs by up to 30% [3].

The PRM market is growing rapidly. The global PRM market was estimated at $90.2 billion in 2024, projected to reach $226.5 billion by 2030 at a 16.6% CAGR [4]. This growth is driven by demand for SaaS-based solutions that integrate with CRM and marketing automation platforms.

But most partner programs still run on disconnected tools. Partnership teams commonly manage deal registrations, lead sharing, and commission tracking across spreadsheets, email threads, and CRM custom objects. This fragmentation leads to poor attribution, channel conflicts, and partner churn. Visibility and clean attribution make commission management straightforward and payments timely — if you want partners engaged, fewer conflicts, and clean data, make registration effortless and visible [1].

---

### Build Order Rationale

1. **Platform Foundation first** — everything depends on the platform being set up with proper security and access
2. **Partner Programs & Onboarding second** — tier structure and program settings are referenced by deal registration and lead sharing workflows
3. **Deal Registration & Lead Sharing third** — these are the core workflows partners interact with daily
4. **CRM Integration fourth** — sync is configured against the workflows already built, so field mapping is informed by actual data fields
5. **Dashboards last** — reporting depends on data flowing through the system

---

### CRM Integration Key Principles

- **Bidirectional sync is non-negotiable** for RevOps accuracy. One-way sync from PRM to CRM creates stale data and sales distrust
- **Define source of truth per field** — partner-facing fields (tier, program type) are PRM-source-of-truth; deal-facing fields (stage, amount) are CRM-source-of-truth
- **Test sync with real scenarios** — create a test partner, submit a test deal registration, update a deal stage in CRM, and verify data flows correctly in both directions before going live

---

### Two-Stage Partner Launch

This project uses a two-stage partner launch to reduce risk:

1. **Pilot (during 3b):** 5-10 engaged partners get early access. They test workflows, provide feedback, and help identify issues before full rollout.
2. **Full Launch (during 3c):** All partners migrated in cohorts. Legacy tools deprecated. Hypercare provides intensive support during transition.

This pattern reduces the blast radius of any issues and gives the partnership team confidence before exposing the full partner base.

---

### Why Maintenance Matters for PRM

The most common failure mode post-PRM-implementation is not a broken system — it's a system that becomes stale because:
- New partners don't get onboarded properly (manual steps creep back)
- CRM sync errors go unnoticed and data trust erodes
- Dashboards stop reflecting reality because field mappings drift
- Deal registration adoption drops when partners don't see value

The maintenance schedule prevents this by making monitoring explicit and cadenced.
