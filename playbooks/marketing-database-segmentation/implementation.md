```

**This project's flow:**
- Full 4-phase. Medium strategy (segmentation criteria alignment), heavy engineering (data enrichment + cleaning + segment build in MAP/CRM), medium enablement (marketing + sales training), medium handoff (governance docs + reporting).
- Phase 2 is where most of the effort lives: data enrichment, standardization, deduplication, and segment construction across MAP and CRM.

#### Definition Alignment Terms

| Term                  | Typical Definition                                                                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Segment               | A defined group of records sharing common criteria used for targeting                  |
| Firmographic criteria | Company-level attributes: industry, size, revenue, geography                           |
| Behavioral criteria   | Engagement-level attributes: email opens, page visits, content downloads               |
| Technographic criteria| Technology stack attributes: tools used, integrations, platforms                        |
| Active/Smart List     | Dynamic list in MAP that auto-updates membership as record properties change           |
| Static List           | Fixed list in MAP capturing a snapshot of records at a point in time                   |
| Enrichment            | Process of adding missing data fields from third-party providers                       |
| Data governance       | Rules and processes for maintaining data quality, standardization, and accuracy         |
| Segment leakage       | Records that should qualify for a segment but don't due to non-standardized field values|

· · ·

#### Common Gotchas
- Non-standardized field values (e.g., "Tech" vs "Technology" vs "IT") causing records to fall through segment filters → Standardize all segmentation fields to picklist values before building any segments
- Orphan contacts without company associations can't be segmented by firmographic criteria → Run domain-based company matching before segment build
- MAP-CRM sync conflicts overwriting segment data → Define MAP as segment source of truth, configure one-way sync for segment fields
- Segments too broad (50,000+) or too narrow (&lt;100) → Validate segment sizes during definition phase; target 500-10,000 records per segment
- Enrichment tool rate limits or coverage gaps → Test enrichment on a sample batch (500 records) before running full database; use waterfall enrichment for maximum coverage [1]

· · ·

#### Methodology Options

| Option                     | When to Use                                          | Complexity |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Firmographic-only          | Clean ICP data exists; quick-win segmentation needed | Low        |
| Firmographic + behavioral  | MAP engagement data available; nurture campaigns planned | Medium |
| Full multi-dimensional     | Firmographic + behavioral + technographic; ABM-ready targeting | High  |

## Phase 1: Strategy

> **Goal:** Get stakeholder sign-off on segmentation criteria, data enrichment plan, and segment definitions.
>
> **Output:** Approved Segmentation Framework Document + Data Requirements Matrix (signed off by Marketing, Sales, RevOps).

### 1a. Pre-Kickoff

> Two parallel tracks run after the deal closes and before the kickoff call.

#### Track A: Customer Homework

**What we send:**

| Item                          | Purpose                                                  | Format             |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Intro video                   | Explain what database segmentation is and project scope   | Video (5-10 min)   |
| Definition Alignment Document | Get sign-off on segment terminology and criteria types    | Google Doc         |
| Pre-filled intake form        | Capture current segmentation pain points and goals        | Google Form or Doc |

**Intake form key questions:**
- What segmentation do you currently use (if any)?
- Which segments or target groups do marketing campaigns focus on today?
- What are the biggest frustrations with how you target your database?
- Do you have a defined ICP or target account list?
- What enrichment tools do you currently pay for (Clay, ZoomInfo, Apollo, Clearbit)?
- What is your budget tolerance for enrichment tooling?

**Completion tracking:** Someone's job to follow up. Don't cancel kickoff if incomplete, but push hard after.

#### Track B: Architect Prep

**What the Architect does:**

| Step | Action                                                        | Output                                |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Pull database summary from CRM/MAP                           | Record counts, field completion rates |
| 2    | Audit existing segments, lists, filters                       | Current state assessment              |
| 3    | Quantify data quality issues (duplicates, orphans, blanks)    | Gap analysis                          |
| 4    | Draft v0 segmentation framework (3-5 dimensions)              | Recommended criteria with ASSUMED tags|
| 5    | Map enrichment tool options to missing fields                 | Preliminary data requirements matrix  |

B2B databases decay at 25-30% per year [2], so the audit should quantify how much data has gone stale and prioritize enrichment accordingly. The average B2B organization has only 44% of contacts with high-quality, complete data [3], making this audit critical.

**Critical:** Mark everything as ASSUMED. The kickoff call validates.

#### Stakeholder Alignment Document

> Get stakeholder sign-off on terms BEFORE building anything.

| Term                  | Our Definition                                                     | Internally Approved? |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| Segment               | A defined group of records sharing common criteria for targeting    | [ ] Yes / [ ] No     |
| ICP                   | Ideal Customer Profile — firmographic description of best-fit accounts | [ ] Yes / [ ] No |
| Firmographic segment  | Segment based on company attributes (industry, size, revenue)      | [ ] Yes / [ ] No     |
| Behavioral segment    | Segment based on engagement activity (opens, clicks, downloads)    | [ ] Yes / [ ] No     |
| Active List           | Dynamic list that auto-updates as contact properties change        | [ ] Yes / [ ] No     |
| Enrichment            | Adding missing data fields from third-party sources                | [ ] Yes / [ ] No     |

**Instructions to customer:**

> Review each definition with your leadership team. Check "Yes" when approved. We cannot proceed until all terms are aligned.

| Final review + sign-off | When all criteria CONFIRMED      |

---

### 1d. Strategic Sign-Off

> **Purpose:** Confirm we have everything before proceeding to engineering.

#### Validation Checkpoint

- [ ] Definition Alignment Document signed off by stakeholders
- [ ] Segmentation criteria framework approved (3-5 dimensions with specific filter logic)
- [ ] Data requirements matrix complete (every field has source + enrichment method)
- [ ] Enrichment budget and tool selection confirmed
- [ ] Segment naming convention agreed
- [ ] Expected segment sizes validated (500-10,000 records per segment target)
- [ ] No blockers for engineering

#### Decision Point

- **Proceed to Engineering** → Customer wants segments built in MAP/CRM (standard path)
- **Strategy-only deliverable** → Rare for this project type. Most customers need the segments built to get value.

---

## Phase 2: Engineering

> **Goal:** Build the segmented database: enrich data, standardize fields, deduplicate, create segments in MAP, sync to CRM.
>
> **Output:** Live segments in MAP/CRM with enriched data, standardized fields, and accurate membership counts.

This is the heaviest phase for Marketing Database Segmentation. Segmented email campaigns generate up to 760% more revenue than unsegmented sends [4], so the engineering work here directly drives campaign ROI.

| Project Type    | Engineering Weight | This Project                                          |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Strategic-heavy | Light (10-20%)     | N/A                                                   |
| Balanced        | Medium (40-60%)    | **Marketing Database Segmentation sits here (50-60%)**|
| Technical-heavy | Heavy (70-90%)     | N/A                                                   |

### Sub-Phases

```
2a Tech Spec → 2b Engineering Handoff → 2c Build → 2d Test
```

---

### 2a. Tech Spec

> **Purpose:** Translate the approved segmentation framework into technical specifications for MAP/CRM.

**Input:** Signed-off segmentation framework + data requirements matrix from Phase 1

**Output:** Draft tech spec containing:

- **Field mappings**: Each segmentation dimension mapped to CRM/MAP fields (existing or new)
  - Industry → `Industry__c` (Salesforce) / `company_industry` (HubSpot)
  - Company size → `Number_of_Employees__c` with defined bands (1-50, 51-200, 201-1000, 1000+)
  - Revenue → `Annual_Revenue__c` with defined bands
  - Job title → `Job_Title_Normalized__c` (C-Level, VP, Director, Manager, IC)
  - Engagement level → `Engagement_Score__c` or behavioral criteria
- **Enrichment workflow**: Which tool enriches which fields, in what order
  - Primary: Clay waterfall enrichment (ZoomInfo → Apollo → Clearbit fallback) [1]
  - Coverage target: 85%+ for primary segmentation fields
- **Standardization rules**: Picklist values for each dimension
- **Segment definitions**: Filter logic (AND/OR conditions) for each segment
- **Build sequence**: Enrich accounts → Enrich contacts → Standardize → Deduplicate → Build segments → Sync to CRM

---

### 2b. Engineering Handoff

> **Purpose:** Review tech specs with engineer before building.

**Who attends:** Architect + Engineer (or MOps resource)

**Agenda (30-45 min):**

| Time  | Topic                  | What Happens                                          |
| ----- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 0-15  | Walk through tech spec | Explain segmentation criteria, enrichment plan, field mappings |
| 15-30 | Engineer questions     | Clarify sync direction, field types, enrichment order  |
| 30-45 | Refine and approve     | Adjust field naming, confirm build approach            |

**What Architect brings:**

- Approved segmentation framework (for strategic context)
- Draft tech spec (from 2a)
- Questions list (any enrichment tool configuration questions)

**What engineer leaves with:**

- Approved tech spec with field mappings
- Clear build sequence (enrich → standardize → deduplicate → build → sync)
- Known risks (sync conflicts, enrichment coverage gaps)

---

### 2c. Build (Configure)

> **Purpose:** Execute the enrichment, standardization, deduplication, and segment creation.

**Input:** Approved tech spec from 2b

**The build sequence:**

**Step 1: Execute Data Enrichment**

1. Set up enrichment tool connections (Clay waterfall with ZoomInfo, Apollo, Clearbit as providers)
2. Configure field mappings between enrichment tool and CRM/MAP
3. Run enrichment on account/company records first (industry, company size, revenue, location)
4. Run enrichment on contact records (job title, department, seniority level)
5. Validate enrichment results with spot checks (10-20 sample records per dimension)
6. Document enrichment coverage rates and any gaps requiring manual research
7. Target: 85%+ field completion on primary segmentation fields

Clay's waterfall enrichment queries multiple data providers in sequence, tripling coverage rates compared to single-provider approaches [1]. A recent benchmark showed single-provider coverage at ~30% improving to 80% with waterfall enrichment.

**Step 2: Standardize Field Values**

1. Create standardized picklist values for industry (consolidate "Tech" / "Technology" / "Information Technology" → "Technology")
2. Define company size bands: 1-50 (SMB), 51-200 (Mid-Market Low), 201-1000 (Mid-Market), 1000+ (Enterprise)
3. Normalize job titles to standard roles: C-Level, VP, Director, Manager, Individual Contributor
4. Build automation rules or use tools like Insycle to apply standardization at scale
5. Validate standardized values match across MAP and CRM
6. Document standardization rules for ongoing data governance

**Step 3: Clean and Deduplicate**

1. Run duplicate detection on contacts and companies (native CRM tools or Insycle/RingLead)
2. Merge or delete duplicate records following defined merge rules (most recent activity wins)
3. Associate orphan contacts to companies using email domain matching
4. Remove invalid records (bounced emails, defunct companies, test data)
5. Verify data sync between MAP and CRM after cleanup
6. Target: &lt;2% duplicate rate, &gt;90% contacts associated to companies

**Step 4: Build Segments in MAP**

1. Build active/smart lists for each segment in HubSpot or Marketo
2. Configure dynamic membership criteria — contacts flow in/out automatically as properties change
3. Apply segment naming convention (e.g., "Industry: Technology | Size: Mid-Market")
4. Set up segment exclusions (do-not-email, competitors, inactive)
5. Verify segment counts match expected estimates from Phase 1

**Step 5: Sync Segments to CRM**

1. Create or update CRM fields to store segment values
2. Configure MAP-to-CRM field mapping for segment fields (MAP = source of truth)
3. Set up one-directional sync rules to push segment membership to CRM
4. Validate sync with test records
5. Verify segment fields are visible on account and contact page layouts
6. Confirm sales team can filter views and reports by segment criteria

**Build tracking:**

- [ ] Enrichment: Account records enriched (coverage: _\_%)
- [ ] Enrichment: Contact records enriched (coverage: _\_%)
- [ ] Standardization: All picklist values applied
- [ ] Deduplication: Duplicate rate below 2%
- [ ] Segments: All segments built in MAP with correct membership
- [ ] Sync: Segment data visible in CRM
- [ ] Reporting: Segment performance dashboards created

---

### 2d. QA / Test + Sign-Off

> **Purpose:** Verify the segments work correctly and get customer approval.

**Two types of testing:**

| Type              | Who      | Purpose                                              |
| ----------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Technical Testing | Our team | Verify enrichment coverage, segment logic, sync accuracy |
| Customer Testing  | Customer | Verify segments match business expectations          |

**Technical testing checklist:**

- [ ] Enrichment coverage 85%+ on primary segmentation fields
- [ ] All picklist values standardized (no "Other" or blank segments above 5% of total)
- [ ] Duplicate rate below 2%
- [ ] Each segment has membership between 500-10,000 records (or documented exception)
- [ ] Segment logic correctly includes/excludes records (test 10 sample records per segment)
- [ ] MAP-to-CRM sync working — segment fields match across systems
- [ ] Segment exclusions functioning (competitors, do-not-email excluded)
- [ ] Reports and dashboards showing segment breakdowns correctly

**Customer testing:**

- Walk customer through each segment: show criteria, membership count, sample records
- Have customer spot-check 5-10 records per segment to validate they belong
- Have sales team test CRM filtering by segment
- Capture feedback, fix issues

**Engineering sign-off checkpoint:**

- [ ] All segments built and matching approved framework
- [ ] Technical tests passing
- [ ] Customer has reviewed and approved segment membership
- [ ] Reporting dashboards live
- [ ] Ready for enablement

**Decision point:**

- **Proceed to Enablement** → Segments live, teams need training
- **Loop back to Build** → Segment membership off, enrichment gaps, sync issues

---

## Phase 3: Enablement

> **Goal:** Marketing and sales teams can use segments for campaigns, targeting, and prioritization without external support.
>
> **Output:** Trained teams with documentation, stabilized segmentation system, no critical issues.

### Sub-Phases

```
3a Training Prep → 3b Training Sessions → 3c Hypercare → 3d Enablement Sign-Off
```

---

### 3a. Training Prep

> **Purpose:** Create training materials from segmentation framework and built segments.

**Input:** Segmentation framework + built segments + MAP/CRM configuration

**Output:** Training package containing:

- **Marketing team guide**: How to select segments for email campaigns, ad audiences, and workflows. Includes segment descriptions, use cases, and best practices for combining segments.
- **Sales team guide**: How to filter CRM views by segment, identify high-priority accounts, and interpret segment fields on record layouts.

3. Answer questions, note gaps for FAQ update
4. Share quick-reference guides after each session

**Output:**

- Trained marketing, sales, and admin stakeholders
- Video walkthroughs for onboarding future team members
- Updated FAQ based on training questions

---

### 3c. Hypercare

> **Purpose:** Intensive post-launch support to stabilize the segmentation system.

**Duration:** 2 weeks

**What happens:**

- Weekly 30-minute office hours slot for questions and troubleshooting
- Quick response to segment issues (same-business-day response)
- Monitor segment membership for unexpected changes
- Fix any enrichment gaps or sync issues discovered during live usage
- Validate first segmented campaign results vs. full-database baseline

**Common hypercare issues for this project:**

| Issue                                        | Resolution                                              |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| New records not entering segments             | Check active list criteria, verify enrichment is running |
| Segment counts changing unexpectedly          | Review recent data imports or enrichment runs            |
| CRM not showing segment fields               | Verify sync rules, check field visibility on layouts     |
| Marketing can't find segments in campaign tool| Confirm list visibility permissions in MAP               |

**When to skip:** Not recommended for this project type. Segments need real-world validation.

**Output:** Stabilized segmentation system, no critical issues outstanding

---

### 3d. Enablement Sign-Off

> **Purpose:** Confirm customer can operate segments independently.

**Validation checkpoint:**

- [ ] Marketing team can independently select segments for campaigns
- [ ] Sales team can filter CRM views by segment
- [ ] RevOps admin can add or modify segments without support
- [ ] All training recordings and documentation delivered
- [ ] Hypercare period complete — no critical issues
- [ ] Customer team can operate without daily support
- [ ] Ready for handoff

**Decision point:**

- **Proceed to Handoff** → Customer is enabled, project wrapping up
- **Extend Hypercare** → Still finding sync issues or segment logic problems

---

## Phase 4: Handoff

> **Goal:** Clean project close with maintenance plan established and retention/expansion path set.
>
> **Output:** Maintenance schedule documented, internal context transferred, customer owns the segmentation system, project archived, future revenue path established.

**Structure:**

```
4a Maintenance Schedule → 4b Internal Handoff → 4c External Handoff → 4d Project Close
                          (SME → Architect)            (LS → Customer)       (Archive + Debrief)
```

**Maintenance ownership by engagement type:**

| Engagement Type               | Who Owns Maintenance | Handed Off At |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------- |
| **Single Project**            | Customer owns        | 4c (External Handoff) |
| **Dedicated (Multi-Project)** | Architect owns       | 4b (Internal Handoff) |

---

### 4a. Maintenance Schedule

> **Purpose:** Document what needs ongoing attention to keep segments accurate and the database healthy.

#### Standard Maintenance Framework

**Monthly Tasks:**

| Monthly Task              | What to Check                                      | Red Flag Threshold                              |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Enrichment refresh        | Run enrichment on new records added in past 30 days| Enrichment coverage drops below 80%             |
| Segment size monitoring   | Review membership counts for all active segments   | Any segment grows &gt;20% or shrinks &gt;20% MoM|
| Data quality spot check   | Sample 20 records per segment for accuracy         | &gt;10% of sampled records incorrectly segmented|

**Quarterly Tasks:**

| Quarterly Task                   | What to Review                                | Action if Off-Track                        |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Full data quality audit          | Field completion rates, duplicate rate, orphan contacts | Re-run deduplication, enrichment refresh |
| Segment criteria review          | Are current segments still aligned with business goals? | Adjust criteria or add new dimensions    |
| Enrichment tool evaluation       | Coverage rates, cost per enrichment, data freshness | Switch providers or add waterfall sources |
| Standardization enforcement      | New non-standard values creeping into picklists | Update automation rules, clean new entries |

**After First Business Cycle (60-90 days post-launch):**

- Measure campaign performance by segment vs. previous full-database sends
- Validate whether segment sizes are producing actionable targeting (not too broad, not too narrow)
- Check if sales team is actively using segment filters in CRM

**Refinement Triggers (when to re-engage):**

| Trigger                                 | Threshold                      | Response                                    |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Enrichment coverage declining           | Below 75% on primary fields    | Re-engage for enrichment refresh project    |
| New market segment needed               | New ICP or product line launch | Scope segment addition mini-project         |
| Segment campaign performance plateauing | Open/click rates declining 3+ months | Review criteria freshness, re-segment   |

**Every 6-12 Months:**

- Full segmentation framework review — do current dimensions still align with GTM strategy?
- Assess new enrichment data sources and tools
- Review segment performance against business outcomes (pipeline by segment, conversion by segment)

---

### 4b. Internal Handoff (SME → Architect)

> **Purpose:** Transfer context so Architect can manage ongoing relationship.

**What the Architect needs to know:**

- Segmentation criteria logic and how segments were designed (strategic context from Phase 1)
- Enrichment tool configuration details (Clay waterfall setup, API keys, field mappings)
- MAP/CRM sync direction and rules (MAP = source of truth for segment fields)
- Data governance rules and standardization picklists
- Common issues and resolutions (see Hypercare table above)
- When to escalate back to SME

**Escalation guidelines:**

| Issue Type                                    | Who Handles              | Example                                          |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Small tweaks, minor questions                 | Architect                | "Add a segment filter," "update picklist value"  |
| Enrichment source changes, segment logic redesign | SME                 | "Switch enrichment provider," "add technographic dimension" |

**For Dedicated engagements:** Architect receives the maintenance schedule (4a) and becomes responsible for executing it. SME walks Architect through each maintenance task.

---

### 4c. External Handoff (LS → Customer)

> **Purpose:** Formal project completion with customer.

**Final project meeting:**

- Review all segments delivered: names, criteria, membership counts
- Walk through documentation package
- Demo reporting dashboards showing segment-level performance
- Walk through data governance rules and enrichment maintenance process
- Confirm nothing outstanding
- Make it explicit: "Project complete"
- **For Single Project engagements:** Hand over the maintenance schedule (4a) and walk through each monthly/quarterly task

**Documentation package:**

- Segmentation framework document (criteria, definitions, filter logic)
- Data governance rules (standardization picklists, enrichment cadence, merge rules)
- Enrichment configuration guide (tool setup, field mappings, waterfall order)
- Training video walkthroughs (marketing, sales, admin)
- Quick-reference guides (segment usage for marketing and sales)
- Troubleshooting guide (common issues + resolutions)
- FAQ document
- Maintenance schedule

**For Single Project engagements:** Walk the customer through the maintenance schedule in detail. Record a video walkthrough of the process.

**Output:** Customer owns the segmentation system. Project formally complete.

---

### 4d. Project Close

> **Purpose:** Clean internal wrap-up + establish retention/expansion path.

#### Archive Checklist

- [ ] All project artifacts saved to proper location
- [ ] Handoff documentation complete
- [ ] Project status updated in tracking system
- [ ] Time/billing finalized

#### Internal Debrief (Optional but Recommended)

- What went well? (e.g., enrichment coverage exceeded target, customer highly engaged)
- What would we do differently? (e.g., should have tested enrichment on sample first)
- Any learnings to feed back into SOPs? (e.g., new enrichment waterfall sequence)

#### Retention / Expansion

**Two paths based on engagement type:**

| Engagement Type               | Path                         |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Single Project**            | Upsell → Downsell → Retry    |
| **Multi-Project (Dedicated)** | Schedule Refinement Check-In |

**Single Project Path:**

```
1. Upsell: Managed Services (retainer for ongoing enrichment + segment maintenance)
   ↓ if no
2. Downsell: Email Operations Nurture Program (uses segments we built) or Lead Scoring Model
   ↓ if yes
3. Retry retainer at end of next project cycle
```

**Script:**

> "Now that your segmentation framework is live, there are two ways we can continue working together. Option 1: We can set you up on managed services where we handle ongoing enrichment, segment optimization, and data governance. Option 2: If you're ready to use these segments for targeted nurture campaigns or lead scoring, we can scope that out as a next project. Which sounds more interesting?"

**Multi-Project (Dedicated) Path:**

Schedule a refinement check-in at handoff:

> "On [date ~quarter out], we'll review how your segments are performing — campaign engagement by segment, data quality trends — and see if any adjustments are needed."

**Internal prep (2 weeks before check-in):**

| Step                | What Happens                                              |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Get pinged       | System reminder: refinement check-in in 2 weeks          |
| 2. Review metrics   | Pull segment performance data, enrichment coverage rates  |
| 3. Decide ownership | Can Architect handle this check-in, or need SME?         |
| 4. Prep materials   | If SME needed, brief them. If Architect, prep data review.|

**At the refinement check-in:**

- Review segment campaign performance vs. baseline (20%+ improvement in engagement is the benchmark [6])
- Identify any segments with declining membership or performance
- If minor: Architect handles criteria adjustments
- If major: Scope new project (add dimensions, re-enrich, rebuild)

**Output:** Project archived. Future revenue path established. Ready for next engagement.

---

### Adaptation Rules

This project is **Balanced** — significant engineering work (enrichment + segment build) combined with meaningful strategy (criteria alignment) and enablement (multi-audience training).

| Project Profile       | Strategy Weight | Engineering Weight | Enablement Weight | This Project         |
| --------------------- | --------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | -------------------- |
| **Strategic-heavy**   | 60-80%          | 10-20%             | 10-20%            |                      |
| **Balanced**          | 30-40%          | 30-40%             | 20-30%            | **Yes (30/50/20)**   |
| **Engineering-heavy** | 10-20%          | 60-80%             | 10-20%            |                      |

- Phase 1 can compress if customer already has ICP definition and clear segmentation goals
- Phase 2 expands if database is large (100K+ records), data quality is poor, or multiple enrichment sources needed
- Phase 3 expands if multiple teams need training or if ABM segments require advanced usage training
- Phase 4 always applies — data governance documentation is critical for segment longevity

---

### Engineering Key Principles

**Tech Spec (2a):** Translate strategy to technical specs. Validate field naming and enrichment order before building.

**Engineering Handoff (2b):** Engineer should understand WHY specific dimensions were chosen (strategic context) — not just the technical implementation. This prevents "just add more fields" scope creep.

**Build (2c):** Follow the sequence: enrich accounts first (firmographic data), then contacts (title/role data), then standardize, then deduplicate, then build segments. Out-of-order execution causes rework.

---

### Enablement Key Principles

**Multi-audience training (3b):** Marketing, Sales, and Admin each need different training. Marketing needs campaign targeting. Sales needs CRM filtering. Admin needs segment maintenance. Do not combine these into one session.

**Hypercare (3c):** Office hours pattern — put recurring time on calendar. First segmented campaign send is the real test. Be available for questions when it goes out.

---

### Handoff Key Principles

**Maintenance Schedule (4a):** Database segmentation requires ongoing maintenance. B2B data decays at 25-30% annually [2]. Without monthly enrichment refreshes and quarterly quality audits, segments degrade within 6 months.

**Data governance is the real handoff:** The segmentation framework itself is straightforward. What makes or breaks long-term value is whether the customer maintains standardized field values, runs enrichment on new records, and enforces picklist discipline. The governance document is the most important handoff artifact.
