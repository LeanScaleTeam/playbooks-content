**This project's flow:**
- Full 4-phase. Medium strategy (audit + process design), heavy engineering (lead capture tool, CRM campaigns, dashboards, automations), medium enablement (marketing + sales training), standard handoff.
- Ideal to time Phase 2 completion 2-3 weeks before the client's next scheduled physical event so it can serve as a live pilot.

- Who owns: Single project = customer owns | Dedicated = ongoing support owns

##### Retention/Expansion Path

**If Single Project:**
Upsell: Managed Services (ongoing event ops support) -> if no -> Downsell: Another project (e.g., Attribution, Marketing Reporting Pack) -> Retry retainer

**If Multi-Project (Dedicated):**
- Refinement check-in scheduled: ~quarter out after first 2-3 events have run through the system
- Internal prep trigger: 2 weeks before
- Decision: Ongoing support handles / specialist needed

#### Key Assets

| Asset                          | When Used              |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------- |

#### Definition Alignment Terms

| Term                    | Typical Definition                                                                                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Event-Sourced Pipeline  | Opportunities where the first qualifying touch came from a physical event interaction                         |
| Event-Influenced Pipeline | Opportunities where an event contact engaged at the event but was not the original source of the opportunity |
| Event Tier              | Classification of events (Tier 1/2/3) based on investment level and expected ROI                              |
| Lead Capture            | The process and tools used to collect attendee contact information and qualification data at physical events   |
| Event ROI               | (Event-Influenced Pipeline Revenue - Total Event Cost) / Total Event Cost                                    |
| Attribution Window      | The time period (30/60/90-day or 6-month) within which pipeline created is credited to an event               |
| Campaign Member Status  | CRM record tracking a contact's engagement level with an event (Registered, Attended, Met with Rep, Demo Requested) |
| 40-20-40 Framework      | Resource allocation principle: 40% pre-event planning, 20% on-site execution, 40% post-event follow-up       |

#### Common Gotchas
- Lead capture tool loses Wi-Fi at venue -> pre-load event form for offline mode, test offline sync before the event
- Badge scanner returns only name + company, missing email -> configure backup manual capture form with required email field
- Sales reps ignore event leads because they look like cold inbound -> tag leads with event context and qualification notes visible on the CRM record
- ROI measured at 30 days shows poor results for enterprise deals -> set attribution windows aligned to actual sales cycle (90-day minimum for mid-market, 6-month for enterprise)
- Multiple CRM campaigns for the same event cause double-counting -> enforce parent-child campaign hierarchy with one parent per event
- Post-event lead upload delayed 3-5 days -> automate same-day sync from capture tool; set 24-hour SLA alert for any manual upload

#### Methodology Options

| Option              | When to Use                                   | Complexity |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| First-Touch Attribution | Company runs few events and wants clear sourcing | Low        |
| Multi-Touch Attribution | Company runs many events alongside digital campaigns | High       |
| Influenced Pipeline     | Company wants broad view of event impact on deals | Medium     |

## Phase 1: Strategy

> **Goal:** Get stakeholder sign-off on event process workflows, metrics framework, lead capture approach, and ROI methodology.
>
> **Output:** Definition Alignment Document + Event Process SOP + ROI Methodology (signed off by stakeholders).

### 1a. Pre-Kickoff

> Two parallel tracks run before the kickoff call.

#### Track A: Customer Homework

**What we send:**

| Item                          | Purpose                                                    | Format             |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Intro video                   | Explain the 40-20-40 framework and what this project delivers | Video walkthrough (5-10 min) |
| Definition Alignment Document | Get sign-off on event-sourced, event-influenced, event tiers, ROI formula | Google Doc         |
| Event intake form             | Capture upcoming events, current tools, budget, historical data | Google Form or Doc |

**What the intake form collects:**
- List of upcoming physical events for the next 6 months with estimated budget per event
- Current lead capture methods (badge scanners, paper forms, apps, manual entry)
- CRM platform and MAP platform in use (Salesforce/HubSpot, Marketo/HubSpot/Pardot)
- Existing campaign structure and naming conventions (if any)
- Historical event data: costs, leads generated, pipeline attributed, revenue closed (last 3-5 events)
- Current follow-up process: who follows up, when, what tools
- Sales cycle length by segment (needed for attribution window decisions)

**Completion tracking:** RevOps or Marketing Ops contact owns getting this done. Push hard for historical data -- it's needed for benchmarking.

#### Track B: Architect Prep

**What the Architect does:**

| Step | Action                                                           | Output                                   |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Pull CRM data: existing campaigns, event-tagged leads, source fields | Raw data on current event tracking state |
| 2    | Audit last 3-5 events for capture methods and data quality       | Current state assessment                 |
| 3    | Benchmark against industry standards                             | Gap analysis with industry comparisons   |
| 4    | Draft v0 event process SOP with recommended workflows            | v0 Event SOP                             |
| 5    | Prepare kickoff call assets: gap analysis, process maps, questions | Kickoff presentation package             |

**Critical:** Mark everything as ASSUMED. The kickoff call validates.

#### Stakeholder Alignment Document

> Get stakeholder sign-off on terms BEFORE building anything. Event projects stall when marketing and sales disagree on what counts as "event-sourced" pipeline.

| Term                       | Our Definition                                                                                | Internally Approved? |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Event-Sourced Pipeline     | Opportunity where first qualifying touch was a physical event interaction                      | [ ] Yes / [ ] No     |
| Event-Influenced Pipeline  | Opportunity where a contact engaged at event but opportunity was created through another channel | [ ] Yes / [ ] No     |
| Event Tier (1/2/3)         | Classification based on total investment: T1 > $50K, T2 $15-50K, T3 &lt; $15K                | [ ] Yes / [ ] No     |
| Event ROI Formula          | (Pipeline Influenced Revenue - Total Event Cost) / Total Event Cost                           | [ ] Yes / [ ] No     |
| Attribution Window         | 90-day default, 180-day for enterprise segments                                               | [ ] Yes / [ ] No     |
| Follow-Up SLA              | Hot leads: same-day. Warm leads: 24 hours. All others: 48 hours.                              | [ ] Yes / [ ] No     |
| Campaign Member Statuses   | Registered > Attended > Met with Rep > Demo Requested > Opportunity Created                   | [ ] Yes / [ ] No     |

**Instructions to customer:**

> Review each definition with your marketing and sales leadership. Check "Yes" when approved. We cannot proceed with engineering until all terms are aligned -- especially the distinction between event-sourced and event-influenced pipeline, as this drives dashboard logic.

---

### 1b. Kickoff Call

> **Purpose:** Present v0 audit and gap analysis. We walk in with work done -- customer reacts, not creates from scratch.

#### Agenda (60-90 min)

| Time  | Topic                        | What Happens                                                       |
| ----- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |

| Final review + sign-off | When all process decisions confirmed         |
| Ideal: complete before  | 3 weeks before next scheduled physical event |

---

### 1d. Strategic Sign-Off

> **Purpose:** Confirm we have everything before proceeding to engineering.

#### Validation Checkpoint

- [ ] Definition Alignment Document signed off by marketing and sales stakeholders
- [ ] Event tier classifications agreed for upcoming events
- [ ] Lead capture tool selected and procurement approved
- [ ] Event process SOP (pre-event, on-site, post-event workflows) approved
- [ ] ROI methodology and attribution windows confirmed
- [ ] Lead routing rules and follow-up SLAs signed off by sales
- [ ] Pilot event identified with date confirmed
- [ ] CRM campaign hierarchy and naming conventions agreed
- [ ] No blockers for engineering

#### Decision Point

- **Proceed to Engineering** -> Customer wants full build (lead capture, CRM campaigns, dashboards, automations)
- This project type always proceeds to Engineering. The strategic deliverable alone (Event SOP) has value, but the ROI is in the automated lead flow and dashboards.

---

## Phase 2: Engineering

> **Goal:** Build the lead capture integration, CRM campaign structure, automated lead flows, and ROI dashboards.
>
> **Output:** Working system tested end-to-end with sample data, ready for first live event.

| Project Profile | Engineering Weight | Description                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| This project    | Heavy (50-60%)     | Lead capture tool config, CRM campaigns, workflow automations, 3+ dashboards |

### Sub-Phases

```
2a Tech Spec -> 2b Engineering Handoff -> 2c Build -> 2d Test
```

---

### 2a. Tech Spec

> **Purpose:** Translate strategic package into technical specifications.

**Input:** Signed-off Event SOP + ROI Methodology + Tool Selection

**Output:** Draft tech spec containing:

- Lead capture tool configuration: required fields, qualification questions, offline mode settings
- CRM campaign structure: parent-child hierarchy template, member status flow, naming convention
- Integration specs: lead capture tool -> CRM (native, API, or Zapier), MAP sync, enrichment triggers
- Lead flow automation: routing rules (territory, account ownership, round-robin), assignment notifications, task creation
- Dashboard specifications: 3 dashboards (Lead Metrics, Pipeline, ROI Summary) with field mappings, filters, calculated fields
- Post-event report template: automated data pulls, manual sections, delivery schedule
- Build sequence and estimated hours per component

---

### 2b. Engineering Handoff

> **Purpose:** Review tech specs before building.

**Agenda (30-45 min):**

| Time  | Topic              | What Happens                                                 |
| ----- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0-15  | Walk through specs | Architect explains event workflows, ROI methodology, tool decisions |
| 15-30 | Engineer questions | Clarify CRM-specific implementation, flag integration risks  |
| 30-45 | Refine and approve | Adjust specs, confirm build sequence                         |

**Key risks to discuss:**
- Lead capture tool API rate limits or field mapping limitations
- CRM edition constraints (e.g., campaign influence reports require Salesforce Enterprise+)
- MAP integration complexity (real-time vs. batch sync)
- Dashboard performance with large datasets

---

### 2c. Build (Configure)

> **Purpose:** Build the entire event operations system.

**Build sequence (recommended order):**

**Component 1: CRM Campaign Structure**
- [ ] Create campaign hierarchy template (parent for event, children for sessions/activities)
- [ ] Configure campaign member statuses: Registered > Attended > Met with Rep > Demo Requested > Opportunity Created
- [ ] Build cloneable campaign template with pre-set fields
- [ ] Set up UTM parameter conventions for event-related digital touchpoints
- [ ] Document campaign naming convention (e.g., `FY26-EVENT-[Tier]-[EventName]-[Type]`)
- [ ] Configure campaign attribution settings (first-touch and influenced)

**Component 2: Lead Capture Tool Configuration**
- [ ] Configure lead capture forms with required fields (First Name, Last Name, Email, Company, Title, Qualification Notes)
- [ ] Set up QR code or badge scanning with field auto-population
- [ ] Configure offline mode and sync behavior
- [ ] Set up lead scoring/tagging within the capture tool (Hot/Warm/Cold)
- [ ] Map capture tool fields to CRM fields

**Component 3: Lead Flow Automation**
- [ ] Build integration: lead capture tool -> CRM (API, native, or Zapier)
- [ ] Configure automatic lead creation or update with campaign membership
- [ ] Set up lead enrichment triggers (ZoomInfo, Clearbit, or Apollo)
- [ ] Build routing rules: territory-based, account-ownership match, or round-robin fallback
- [ ] Create automated lead assignment notifications to sales reps
- [ ] Configure same-day follow-up task creation for assigned reps with event context
- [ ] Build SLA alert: flag leads unactioned after 24 hours

**Component 4: ROI Dashboards**
- [ ] Build Dashboard 1 -- Lead Metrics: leads captured by event, MQL conversion rate, SQL conversion rate, capture method breakdown
- [ ] Build Dashboard 2 -- Pipeline: opportunities created, pipeline value by event and timeframe (30/60/90/180-day), event-sourced vs. event-influenced split
- [ ] Build Dashboard 3 -- ROI Summary: total cost vs. pipeline by event, projected vs. actual ROI, cost per lead, cost per opportunity
- [ ] Add trend analysis views: event performance over time, year-over-year comparison
- [ ] Configure drill-down capability to individual event and lead level
- [ ] Set up scheduled report delivery to stakeholders (weekly during event season, monthly otherwise)

**Component 5: Post-Event Report Template**
- [ ] Design report template: goals vs. actuals, lead summary, pipeline snapshot, ROI calculation, qualitative learnings
- [ ] Configure automated data pulls for lead count, pipeline, and conversion metrics
- [ ] Include benchmarking section: compare to previous events and industry averages
- [ ] Add executive summary format for leadership reviews
- [ ] Set report cadence: preliminary at 30 days post-event, final at 90 days

---

### 2d. QA / Test + Sign-Off

> **Purpose:** Verify the entire lead flow works end-to-end before a live event.

**Technical testing checklist:**

- [ ] Lead captured on device -> appears in CRM within 5 minutes (or on sync for offline)
- [ ] Campaign membership created automatically with correct status
- [ ] Lead enrichment fires (ZoomInfo/Clearbit/Apollo populates fields)
- [ ] Lead routed to correct rep based on routing rules
- [ ] Assignment notification sent to rep
- [ ] Follow-up task created with event context and SLA deadline
- [ ] SLA alert fires for unactioned leads after 24 hours
- [ ] Dashboards render correctly with test data
- [ ] ROI calculations match manual spreadsheet verification
- [ ] Campaign attribution correctly distinguishes event-sourced vs. event-influenced
- [ ] Post-event report template auto-populates lead and pipeline metrics
- [ ] Offline capture syncs correctly when connectivity restored

**Customer testing:**

- Walk customer marketing ops through the full lead capture -> CRM flow
- Have them test creating a lead on the capture tool and verify it appears in CRM
- Review dashboards together, confirm filters and drill-downs work
- Validate ROI formula output against known historical event data

**Engineering sign-off checkpoint:**

- [ ] Built system matches tech spec
- [ ] All technical tests passing
- [ ] Customer has tested and approved
- [ ] Ready for enablement and first live event

---

## Phase 3: Enablement

> **Goal:** Marketing and sales teams can execute events using the new processes and tools.
>
> **Output:** Trained teams with documentation, successful first live event, no critical issues.

### Sub-Phases

```
3a Training Prep -> 3b Training Sessions -> 3c Hypercare -> 3d Enablement Sign-Off
```

---

### 3a. Training Prep

### 3c. Hypercare

> **Purpose:** Intensive support through the first live event using the new system.

**Duration:** From training delivery through first live event + 2 weeks post-event

**What happens:**

- **Pre-event (1-2 weeks before):** Help set up CRM campaign for pilot event, verify lead capture tool is loaded and tested, confirm routing rules point to correct reps
- **During event (day-of):** Available for real-time troubleshooting. Monitor lead capture sync in real-time. Flag any data quality issues immediately.
- **Post-event (2 weeks after):** Review lead upload completeness and timing. Verify automation fired correctly. Pull preliminary dashboard data at 7 days. Produce 30-day preliminary report together.
- **Office hours:** Weekly 30-min slot for questions, troubleshooting, and process adjustments

**When to extend hypercare:** If the first event has major issues (capture tool failure, integration errors, routing problems), extend through the second event.

---

### 3d. Enablement Sign-Off

> **Purpose:** Confirm customer can run events independently with the new system.

**Validation checkpoint:**

- [ ] All three training sessions delivered and recorded
- [ ] Marketing team successfully operated lead capture at first live event
- [ ] Sales team followed up on event leads within SLA
- [ ] Dashboards populated with real event data and reviewed by stakeholders
- [ ] Preliminary post-event report produced for pilot event
- [ ] No critical issues outstanding
- [ ] Customer team can clone campaigns, capture leads, and interpret dashboards without support
- [ ] Ready for handoff

---

## Phase 4: Handoff

> **Goal:** Clean project close with maintenance plan, continuous improvement framework, and retention path established.
>
> **Output:** Maintenance schedule documented, context transferred, customer owns the system, project archived.

**Structure:**

```
4a Maintenance Schedule -> 4b Internal Handoff -> 4c External Handoff -> 4d Project Close
```

---

### 4a. Maintenance Schedule

> **Purpose:** Document what needs ongoing attention to keep event operations and reporting accurate.

#### Standard Maintenance Framework

**Monthly Tasks:**

| Monthly Task                     | What to Check                                               | Red Flag Threshold                                |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Lead data quality audit          | Incomplete records, missing fields from recent events       | >15% of leads missing required fields             |
| Automation health check          | Lead flow automation firing correctly, no error queue buildup | Any failed automation runs in the last 30 days    |
| Dashboard data accuracy          | Spot-check 5 leads end-to-end (capture -> CRM -> dashboard) | Any discrepancy between source data and dashboard |

**Quarterly Tasks:**

| Quarterly Task                     | What to Review                                            | Action if Off-Track                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Event ROI comparative analysis     | ROI across all events in quarter vs. tier expectations     | Reclassify event tiers, adjust budget allocation     |
| Attribution window validation      | Check if 90-day window captures enough pipeline for sales cycle | Extend or shorten windows based on actual data       |
| Lead capture tool evaluation       | Usage patterns, data quality by capture method             | Retrain staff on underused features, update forms    |
| Sales follow-up SLA compliance     | % of event leads followed up within SLA                   | Escalate to sales leadership if &lt;80% compliance      |

**After First Business Cycle (90 days post-launch):**

- Review aggregate ROI across first 2-3 events using the new system
- Compare lead upload speed (target: same-day) to pre-project baseline (typical: 3-5 day delay)
- Validate attribution model against actual closed deals -- is the right pipeline being credited?
- Assess dashboard adoption: are stakeholders actually using the reports weekly?
- Key question: Does the event-sourced pipeline conversion rate outperform other channels? Industry benchmark: event leads convert at 5-10% compared to 1-2% for cold outbound [2][3]

**Refinement Triggers (when to re-engage):**

| Trigger                            | Threshold                                  | Response                                          |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Event ROI consistently below 3:1   | 2+ consecutive events below threshold      | Review attribution windows, requalify event tiers  |
| Lead follow-up SLA dropping        | &lt;70% compliance for 2+ events              | Re-engage for sales enablement refresh         |
| Lead capture data quality declining | >20% incomplete records for 2+ events      | Retrain on-site staff, simplify capture form        |
| New event type added               | Client starts hosting field events or dinners | Scope new campaign templates and capture workflows  |

**Every 6-12 Months:**

- Full event program review: which events should continue, which should be dropped based on ROI data
- Lead capture tool contract review: is current tool still the right fit given event volume?
- Dashboard refresh: add new metrics, update visualizations based on stakeholder feedback
- Process SOP update: incorporate learnings from post-event reports into updated playbook

---

### 4b. Internal Handoff

> **Purpose:** Transfer context so ongoing support can manage the event ops relationship.

**What needs to be transferred:**

- Event calendar cadence and which events are Tier 1/2/3
- Which dashboards to monitor and when (weekly during event season)
- Key stakeholder relationships (VP Marketing, Field Marketing lead, RevOps contact)
- Attribution methodology decisions and why they were made
- First event results as baseline for future comparisons

**Escalation guidelines:**

| Issue Type                                                | Who Handles                            | Example                                         |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Campaign cloning, dashboard filter changes, new user access | Standard support                      | "We need a campaign set up for our next event"   |
| Lead capture tool configuration changes, routing rule updates | Standard support (with checklist)    | "We want to add a qualification question"        |
| Attribution logic changes, new dashboard builds, integration updates | Specialist escalation        | "We want to switch from first-touch to multi-touch" |
| System errors, broken integrations, data sync failures    | Escalate immediately                   | "Leads aren't flowing from the capture tool"     |

---

### 4c. External Handoff (to Customer)

> **Purpose:** Formal project completion with customer.

**Final project meeting:**

**Troubleshooting Guide:**

| Scenario                                    | Symptoms                                          | Resolution                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lead capture tool not syncing               | Leads visible in app but not in CRM               | Check API connection, verify field mapping, check for sync queue errors       |
| Leads not routing to correct rep            | Leads sitting in default queue unassigned          | Verify routing rules are active, check territory/account ownership alignment  |
| Dashboard showing $0 pipeline for an event  | Event campaign exists but pipeline dashboard empty | Confirm campaign attribution settings, check attribution window date range   |
| Duplicate leads created post-event          | Same contact appears 2+ times in CRM              | Check dedup rules on lead creation, verify capture tool matching logic        |
| ROI calculation looks wrong                 | ROI numbers don't match manual calculation         | Verify cost data is entered correctly, check pipeline attribution window     |
| Badge scanner returning incomplete data     | Only name + company, missing email                 | Use backup manual form with required email field, check scanner API mapping  |
| Sales reps not receiving assignment alerts  | Leads assigned but no notification                 | Verify notification workflow is active, check rep email preferences    |
| Offline captured leads lost                 | Leads captured at venue but never appear in CRM    | Check device sync queue, verify offline mode was properly enabled pre-event  |

---

### 4d. Project Close

> **Purpose:** Clean internal wrap-up + establish retention/expansion path.

#### Archive Checklist

- [ ] All project artifacts saved to proper location
- [ ] Handoff documentation complete
- [ ] Project status updated in tracking system
- [ ] Time/billing finalized
- [ ] Pilot event results documented

#### Internal Debrief (Optional but Recommended)

- What went well? (first event execution, dashboard adoption, sales follow-up compliance)
- What would we do differently? (tool selection process, training format, build sequence)
- Any learnings to feed back into SOPs?

#### Retention / Expansion

**Single Project Path:**

```
1. Upsell: Managed Services (ongoing event ops support, pre/post every major event)
   | if no
   v
2. Downsell: Related one-time project (Marketing Reporting Pack, Attribution, Inbound Lead Journey Mapping)
   | if yes
   v
3. Retry retainer at end of next project cycle
```

**Script:**

> "Now that your event operations system is live and your pilot event showed [X pipeline generated], there are two ways we can continue. Option 1: We manage your event ops ongoing -- we set up campaigns, run post-event reports, and optimize your process before every major event. Option 2: If there's another project that connects well, like building out your full marketing attribution model or marketing reporting pack, we can scope that out. Which sounds more interesting?"

**Multi-Project (Dedicated) Path:**

Schedule a refinement check-in at handoff:

> "On [date ~quarter out], after you've run 2-3 more events through the system, we'll review performance and see if any adjustments are needed."

**Internal prep (2 weeks before check-in):**

| Step                | What Happens                                                          |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Get pinged       | System reminder: refinement check-in in 2 weeks                      |
| 2. Review metrics   | Pull event ROI data, SLA compliance, dashboard usage                  |
| 3. Decide ownership | Can standard support handle this check-in, or is a specialist needed? |
| 4. Prep materials   | Brief relevant team member and prep talking points from dashboard data. |
