# Physical Event Process & ROI Reporting — Advisory

Physical Event Process and ROI Reporting - Standardized event operations, lead capture automation, and pipeline attribution for in-person events

---

## 1) Project Overview

### What is the name of this project?

Physical Event Process and ROI Reporting - Field Marketing Operations

### What is the purpose of this project?

This project establishes standardized processes for planning, executing, and measuring in-person events (trade shows, conferences, field events), including lead capture workflows, CRM/MAP integration, and ROI reporting dashboards. After this project, the client has a repeatable event playbook with automated lead flow from capture tools into CRM, defined follow-up SLAs, and live dashboards showing leads generated, pipeline influenced, and revenue attributed to each event with 30/60/90-day tracking.

**Core transformation:** From ad-hoc event execution with no visibility into pipeline impact to a data-driven event machine where every dollar spent is tracked against pipeline created and revenue closed.

### What Physical Event Process and ROI Reporting Unlocks

- Automated same-day lead flow from event capture tools into CRM with proper campaign membership and assignment
- Standardized event tier classification (Tier 1/2/3) with pre-set goals, budgets, and ROI benchmarks per tier
- Real-time dashboards showing event-sourced vs. event-influenced pipeline at 30/60/90-day intervals
- Repeatable event SOPs with checklists for pre-event planning, on-site capture, and post-event follow-up
- Post-mortem report templates with automated data pulls for consistent event-over-event comparison
- Sales follow-up SLAs with automatic assignment notifications and task creation

| Before                                                    | After                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Leads uploaded to CRM 3-5 days after event via CSV        | Same-day automated lead flow from capture tool to CRM        |
| No standardized follow-up process; leads go cold          | Automatic sales assignment with SLA alerts and task creation  |
| Event ROI is a guess based on badge scan counts            | Live dashboards with pipeline attribution at 30/60/90 days   |
| Every event managed differently by different team members  | Standardized SOPs, checklists, and campaign templates         |
| No way to compare event performance across events or years | Tiered benchmarking with year-over-year trend analysis        |
| Sales has no context on event leads                        | Pre-event briefings and post-event context passed to reps     |

### What business outcomes does this project drive?

**Primary Outcomes:**

- Event-sourced pipeline becomes trackable and attributable, replacing guesswork with data
- Lead follow-up time drops from 3-5 days to same-day, increasing conversion likelihood by up to 50% [1]
- Marketing can justify event budget with ROI data tied to actual pipeline and revenue
- Sales receives pre-qualified, enriched leads with event context within hours of capture

**Secondary Outcomes:**

- Foundation for event budget optimization by comparing ROI across event tiers and types
- Data-driven event selection for future planning (invest more in high-ROI events, cut low performers)
- Marketing-sales alignment improves as both teams share visibility into event pipeline dashboards

### Who in the Org can benefit from this project?

VP of Marketing, Director of Field Marketing, Marketing Operations Manager, RevOps Manager, VP of Sales, SDR/BDR Manager, Sales Reps (event attendees), CMO/CFO (for budget justification)

### Pain Points this Project Solves

| Pain Point                                                          | What Physical Event Process and ROI Reporting Enables                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "We spend $50K+ per event but can't tell the board what we got back" | ROI dashboards with cost-vs-pipeline views and revenue attribution by event         |
| "Our leads go cold because it takes a week to get them into the CRM" | Automated same-day lead flow from capture tool to CRM with assignment rules          |
| "Sales ignores event leads because they don't trust the quality"    | Lead qualification criteria, engagement scoring, and event context passed to reps    |
| "Every event is run differently depending on who's managing it"     | Standardized SOPs, checklists, and campaign templates cloned for each event          |
| "We can't compare this year's Dreamforce to last year's"            | Consistent campaign hierarchy, naming conventions, and benchmark tracking            |
| "Marketing says events work, sales says they don't, nobody has data" | Shared dashboards showing leads, pipeline, and conversion by event for both teams   |

### The Data Behind the Problem

The gap between event investment and measurable returns is well-documented:

- **80% of trade show leads never receive follow-up**, representing the single largest source of wasted event spend [1]. This is not a data quality problem; it is a process and ownership problem.
- **50% of B2B buyers choose the vendor that responds first** with relevant information after an event [2]. When lead upload takes 3-5 days, the competitive window is already closed.
- **77% of B2B marketing decision-makers say measuring event ROI is one of their greatest challenges** [3]. Without standardized attribution methodology, events become a cost center that is easy to cut.
- The U.S. B2B trade show market reached **$15.78 billion in 2024** [2], yet most companies cannot connect that spend to pipeline. Converting a trade show lead is **38% more cost-effective** than relying on sales calls alone [1].
- **72% of trade show attendees are more likely to buy from exhibitors they meet in person** [2], but this advantage evaporates without systematic follow-up.

### Key Metaphors or Frameworks

**The 40-20-40 Framework:** Event success is 40% pre-event preparation, 20% on-site execution, and 40% post-event follow-up. Most teams over-invest in the 20% (booth, swag, presence) and under-invest in the 40% after (lead processing, follow-up, measurement). This project rebalances that ratio.

**Use it when:** Explaining to clients why "showing up" isn't enough and why the real work happens before and after the event. Helps reframe event marketing from a logistics exercise to a pipeline generation system.

**Don't use it when:** The client already has strong post-event processes but weak on-site capture. In that case, lead with the "leaky bucket" framing (capturing better data on-site).

### Target Motion

This project is designed for **sales-led growth (SLG) and hybrid SLG/inbound** B2B SaaS companies that attend or sponsor physical events as a meaningful part of their demand generation strategy. Best fit for companies spending $100K+ annually on events across 4+ events per year.

*Not a fit for:* Product-led growth companies that don't invest in field marketing. Not for companies running exclusively virtual/digital events (see Event Operations Platform Implementation for that). Not for companies without a CRM or MAP already in place.

## 4) Scoping

### Scoping Factors

**1. Number of Event Types**

- Single type (trade shows only) -- Simpler: one SOP, one campaign template, one set of metrics
- Multiple types (trade shows + conferences + field dinners + hosted events) -- Each type needs its own SOP variant, campaign template, and potentially different capture methods

**2. CRM Platform**

- Salesforce -- Native Campaign Influence, richer attribution options, more complex but more powerful
- HubSpot -- Simpler campaign tracking via lists, less granular attribution out-of-box, faster to implement

**3. Lead Capture Tool Status**

- Already in place and integrated -- Audit and optimize existing setup
- Needs selection and procurement -- Add 2-3 weeks for evaluation, procurement, and initial configuration
- Using paper/manual methods -- Largest lift; need full tool selection, training, and change management

**4. Attribution Model Complexity**

- First-touch only -- Simplest: event gets credit if it sourced the lead
- Influenced model -- Moderate: event gets credit if contact attended before opportunity creation
- Multi-touch weighted -- Complex: requires campaign influence configuration and weighting decisions

**5. Number of Events Per Year**

- 2-5 events/year -- Standard scope; focus on getting the process right
- 6-15 events/year -- Need scalable templates and possibly team-based ownership
- 15+ events/year -- Need automated campaign creation, role-based ownership, and portfolio-level reporting

**6. Sales Cycle Length**

- Under 90 days -- 30/60/90-day attribution windows are sufficient
- 90-180 days -- Need 6-month tracking window; 30-day ROI will consistently understate event value
- 180+ days -- Misaligned attribution windows are the #1 source of "events don't work" conclusions

### Multiple Approaches

**Approach 1: Quick-Start (Pilot Event)**

- Criteria: Client has one event within 60 days and needs to prove the concept before scaling
- Execution: Focus on a single event -- set up campaign, capture tool, lead flow automation, and basic dashboard. Use results to justify full rollout.

**Approach 2: Full Framework Build**

- Criteria: Client runs 5+ events/year and needs standardized operations across all of them
- Execution: Full event tier framework, SOP library, campaign templates, attribution methodology, ROI dashboards, and team training.

**Approach 3: ROI Reporting Retrofit**

- Criteria: Client already has event processes but no attribution or ROI measurement
- Execution: Focus on campaign structure, attribution model, and dashboard build. Less process design, more analytics engineering.

## 5) Discovery Questions

### Questions for Project Kickoff

**Business Context**

- How many physical events do you attend or host per year, and what's the approximate total annual spend? *(Determines scope and tier framework needs)*
- What types of events do you run? Trade shows, conferences, hosted dinners, field events, user groups? *(Each type may need a different SOP)*
- Who currently owns event planning, and who owns post-event lead processing? Are they the same person? *(Identifies organizational gaps)*

**Current State**

- Walk me through what happens to a lead after your team captures their info at an event. How long until that lead is in CRM and assigned to a rep? *(Quantifies the current gap)*
- How do you currently capture leads on-site? Badge scanners, apps, paper forms, business cards? *(Determines lead capture tool needs)*
- Do you have CRM campaigns set up for past events? If so, how consistent is the structure? *(Assesses migration vs. greenfield effort)*
- Can you show me how you currently report on event performance to leadership? *(Reveals reporting gaps)*

**Technical Environment**

- What CRM are you on, and do you have admin access? *(Salesforce vs. HubSpot changes the approach significantly)*
- What marketing automation platform are you using, and is the CRM sync healthy? *(Broken sync = blocker)*
- Do you currently use any lead capture tools, or are you starting from scratch? *(Impacts timeline)*
- Do you use any data enrichment tools (ZoomInfo, Clearbit, Apollo)? *(Determines if enrichment step is needed)*

**Expectations**

- What does success look like 90 days from now? What do you want to be able to answer that you can't today? *(Aligns on outcomes)*
- Is there a specific upcoming event you'd want to use as the pilot for the new process? *(Anchor point for timeline)*
- Who needs to see the ROI dashboards, and what decisions will they make from that data? *(Shapes dashboard design)*

## 6) Overcoming Common Belief Barriers

#### "We already track event leads -- we just upload a spreadsheet after each event."

A spreadsheet uploaded 3-5 days after an event is not lead tracking; it is data archiving. By the time those leads land in CRM, 50% of buyers have already chosen the vendor that responded first [2]. The difference is automation and speed: leads flow into CRM the same day, get enriched, get assigned, and trigger follow-up tasks -- all before a competitor's marketing team has finished their event debrief.

Beyond speed, manual uploads introduce data quality issues. Booth staff handwriting varies, required fields get skipped, and campaign membership is inconsistent. Automated capture with required fields and badge scanning eliminates these problems at the point of capture.

**The reframe:** "You're not tracking leads -- you're archiving contacts. Tracking means the lead is in CRM, assigned to a rep, and being worked within 24 hours."

#### "Events are brand awareness, not lead gen -- you can't really measure ROI."

This belief persists because most companies lack the infrastructure to measure event ROI, not because the ROI isn't there. With proper CRM campaign structure and attribution windows that match the sales cycle, events become one of the most measurable demand generation channels. Salesforce's own data shows Dreamforce attendees have a 28% higher average deal size and close 34% faster than non-attendees [4].

The key is attribution window alignment. If your sales cycle is 6 months and you measure event ROI at 30 days, you will always conclude events don't work. See Methodology for detailed attribution methodology and window selection.

**The reframe:** "Events absolutely have measurable ROI -- you just need the right attribution window and campaign structure to see it. Most companies measure too early and draw the wrong conclusion."

#### "Our sales team follows up on the good leads already."

Without structured routing and SLAs, "follows up" means "sometimes, when they remember, on the leads they personally consider good." Industry data shows 80% of trade show leads never receive follow-up [1]. That is not a lazy sales team -- it is a process failure. When leads arrive without qualification context, without assigned ownership, and without task reminders, follow-up becomes optional. Automated assignment with SLA tracking makes it visible and accountable.

**The reframe:** "If 80% of event leads get no follow-up, the issue isn't effort -- it's infrastructure. Automatic routing with SLA alerts turns good intentions into a tracked process."

#### "We only do 2-3 events a year -- this isn't worth the investment."

Two events at $40K each is $80K in annual spend. If you cannot tell leadership what that $80K produced in pipeline, the budget is vulnerable -- especially when two-thirds of B2B event budgets are flat or declining [8]. The infrastructure built for 2 events works identically for 20. Campaign templates clone in minutes. Dashboards auto-populate. The per-event marginal cost of running the process is near zero once it is built.

**The reframe:** "The fewer events you run, the more each one matters. If you're spending $80K on two events, you need to know exactly what you got back."

- ROI is calculable for every event (cost vs. pipeline vs. revenue)
- Sales follow-up compliance exceeds 85% within 48 hours
- Event-influenced deals show higher conversion rate than baseline (benchmark: 34% higher than digital-only leads [4])
- Post-mortem reports are generated within 30 days of each event with automated data pulls
- Year-over-year event performance comparison is possible
