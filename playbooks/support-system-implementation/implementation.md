   Requirements +       Platform config       Agent training        Admin runbooks +
   platform selection   integrations + KB     staged rollout        maintenance schedule

**This project's flow:**
- Full 4-phase. Medium strategy (requirements + platform selection), heavy engineering (platform configuration, integrations, automations, help center), medium enablement (agent training, staged rollout), standard handoff.
- Phase 2 is the heaviest phase — most of the work is configuring the platform, building automations, setting up integrations, and creating knowledge base content.
- Phase 1 may compress if the platform has already been selected.

## Handoff & Retention

### Internal Handoff (SME → Architect)
- Key context for Architect: Platform configuration choices and rationale, integration architecture, SLA targets and current performance, common agent questions from training
- Escalation trigger: Any workflow/automation logic changes, new integration requests, SLA policy modifications, or platform upgrade decisions

### External Handoff (Implementation Team → Customer)
- Final meeting agenda: Review all delivered assets, walk through admin runbook, confirm support channels operational, hand over maintenance schedule
- Documentation package: All training recordings, admin runbook, agent guide, integration architecture map, SLA policy document, maintenance schedule

### Maintenance Schedule
- Monthly: SLA compliance review, automation effectiveness check, knowledge base gap analysis
- Quarterly: Full platform audit, integration health check, CSAT trend review
- Who owns: Single project = customer owns | Dedicated = Architect owns

### Retention/Expansion Path

**If Single Project:**
Upsell: Managed Services (ongoing optimization, reporting, knowledge base expansion) → if no → Downsell: Knowledge base expansion project or chatbot/AI enhancement → Retry retainer

**If Multi-Project (Dedicated):**
- Refinement check-in scheduled: ~8 weeks post-launch
- Internal prep trigger: 2 weeks before check-in
- Decision: Architect handles routine optimization / SME needed for workflow redesign or new integration

## Definition Alignment Terms

| Term                    | Typical Definition                                                                                                |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| First Response Time     | Time from ticket creation to first human reply (auto-acknowledgments do not count)                                |
| Resolution Time         | Time from ticket creation to ticket marked as solved/closed                                                        |
| SLA Breach              | When a ticket exceeds the defined response or resolution time target for its priority level                       |
| Ticket Deflection       | A support inquiry resolved via self-service (knowledge base, chatbot) without creating a human-handled ticket     |
| CSAT                    | Customer Satisfaction Score — post-resolution survey rating, typically on a 1-5 or 1-10 scale                     |
| Priority Level (P1-P4)  | Severity classification: P1=System Down, P2=Major Impact, P3=Minor Impact, P4=General Question                   |
| Macro                   | Pre-written response template agents use for common ticket types to ensure consistency and speed                   |
| Escalation              | Moving a ticket to a higher-tier agent, supervisor, or cross-functional team (e.g., Engineering for bugs)          |
| Help Center             | Customer-facing self-service portal with knowledge base articles, FAQ, and search                                  |
| Ticket Routing          | Automated assignment of tickets to the correct team or agent based on type, priority, or customer attributes       |

---

## Common Gotchas

- Over-engineering automations on day one — teams build 30+ rules before understanding actual ticket patterns → Start with 5-10 core automations, add more after 30 days of real data [1]
- CRM integration only pulling basic contact info, missing ARR, customer tier, or CSM assignment → Map all customer context fields upfront and test the agent sidebar view before launch
- Launching help center with fewer than 15 articles and expecting meaningful ticket deflection → Commit to 20-30 articles minimum at launch, targeting the top 10 ticket drivers from audit data. Companies with mature knowledge bases achieve 20-45% ticket deflection [2]
- Selecting platform based on feature demos instead of actual requirements → Start with the requirements document, not vendor demos. Match platform complexity to team size and maturity
- No SLA baseline before launch → Measure current response/resolution times during the audit phase to set realistic targets and demonstrate improvement. Satisfaction drops sharply beyond the 8-12 hour response window [3]
- Forgetting to configure offline chat handling → Set up offline message capture and auto-response for after-hours chat requests before go-live

## Methodology Options

| Option              | When to Use                                         | Complexity |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Simple (email-only) | &lt;500 tickets/month, 1-3 agents, no live chat needed | Low        |
| Standard (multi-channel) | 500-5000 tickets/month, 3-15 agents, email + chat + help center | Medium |
| Advanced (full omnichannel + AI) | 5000+ tickets/month, 15+ agents, all channels + AI bot + advanced routing | High |

> See Methodology for detailed decision framework on platform selection and configuration depth.

---

## Phase 1: Strategy

> **Goal:** Get stakeholder sign-off on what we're going to build — platform selection, SLA targets, integration scope, rollout plan.
>
> **Output:** Signed-off requirements document + platform selection + SLA definitions + integration architecture.

### 1a. Pre-Kickoff

> Two parallel tracks run before the kickoff call.

#### Track A: Customer Homework

**What we send:**

| Item                          | Purpose                                                      | Format             |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| Intro video                   | Explain what a support system implementation involves         | Video walkthrough (5-10 min) |
| Definition Alignment Document | Get stakeholder sign-off on support terminology (SLA, CSAT, FRT, etc.) | Google Doc |
| Support Operations Intake Form| Capture current channels, volume, team size, pain points, requirements | Google Form |

**What we include in the intake form:**
- Current support channels in use (email, chat, phone, social)
- Monthly ticket/email volume (last 90 days if available)
- Current team size and roles (Tier 1, Tier 2, specialized)
- Top 5 pain points in current support workflow
- CRM in use (Salesforce, HubSpot, other)
- Engineering project tool (Jira, Linear, other)
- Internal communication tool
- Existing knowledge base or FAQ content (if any)
- Budget range for platform licensing
- SSO/SAML requirements
- Brand guidelines location

**Completion tracking:** Follow up within 3 business days. Don't cancel kickoff if incomplete, but push hard — the audit quality depends on having real volume data.

#### Track B: Architect Prep

**What the Architect does:**

| Step | Action                                                                 | Output                                 |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Gather inputs (intake form, CRM access, current inbox/system access)   | Raw data collected                     |
| 2    | Analyze support volume data (last 90 days of tickets/emails)           | Volume distribution, peak times, categories |
| 3    | Document current response time averages and support workflow            | Baseline metrics                       |
| 4    | Map current escalation paths (who handles what, how bugs reach engineering) | Escalation flow diagram            |
| 5    | Produce gap analysis + draft requirements                              | Gap analysis v0, requirements v0       |

**Critical:** Mark everything as ASSUMED. The kickoff call validates.

#### Stakeholder Alignment Document

> Get stakeholder sign-off on terms BEFORE building anything.

| Term                | Our Definition                                                                     | Internally Approved? |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| First Response Time | Time from ticket creation to first human reply (excludes auto-acknowledgments)     | [ ] Yes / [ ] No     |
| Resolution Time     | Time from ticket creation to ticket marked solved/closed                            | [ ] Yes / [ ] No     |
| SLA                 | Service Level Agreement — contractual response/resolution time targets by priority | [ ] Yes / [ ] No     |
| CSAT                | Customer Satisfaction — post-resolution survey on 1-5 scale                        | [ ] Yes / [ ] No     |
| Ticket Deflection   | Inquiry resolved via self-service without creating a human-handled ticket           | [ ] Yes / [ ] No     |
| Priority Levels     | P1: System Down, P2: Major Impact, P3: Minor Impact, P4: General Question          | [ ] Yes / [ ] No     |
| Escalation          | Moving ticket to higher tier, supervisor, or cross-functional team                  | [ ] Yes / [ ] No     |

**Instructions to customer:**

> Review each definition with your leadership team. Check "Yes" when approved. These definitions will drive your SLA policies, reporting, and team workflows. Misalignment here causes rework later.

---

### 1b. Kickoff Call

> **Purpose:** Present audit findings and v0 requirements. Customer reacts and corrects, doesn't create from scratch.

#### Agenda (60-90 min)

| Time  | Topic                      | What Happens                                                      |
| ----- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0-15  | Walk through gap analysis  | "Here's what we found in your current support operations"         |
| 15-30 | Present v0 requirements    | Channels, SLAs, integrations, user roles — all marked ASSUMED     |
| 30-40 | Definition alignment       | Review Definition Alignment Document                              |
| 40-55 | Validate and correct       | ASSUMED → CONFIRMED or corrected                                  |
| 55-70 | Platform discussion        | If not yet selected: present evaluation approach. If selected: confirm. |
| 70-80 | Identify gaps              | What data is missing, who owns it                                 |
| 80-90 | Next steps                 | Schedule refinement meetings, assign homework                     |

#### What We Bring

- Gap analysis (v0) showing current state vs. desired capabilities
- Draft requirements document with ASSUMED values
- Baseline metrics (current response times, volume distribution)
- Definition Alignment Document (pre-filled with recommendations)
- Platform evaluation scorecard (if platform not yet selected)

#### What We Leave With

- Corrections and validations on requirements (info for v1)
- Confirmed or contested definitions
- Platform preference or evaluation criteria
- Clear homework assignments (theirs: CRM access, brand assets, team list; ours: updated requirements, platform recommendation)

---

### 1c. Alignment Loop & Strategic Meeting Cadence

> **Purpose:** Iterate on requirements and platform selection until sign-off.

#### The Pattern

```
Kickoff Call (gather info, validate gaps)
    ↓
Process feedback → v1 requirements
    ↓
Meeting 2 (platform + SLA alignment) → v2 requirements
    ↓
Meeting 3 (integrations + KB + rollout plan) → final requirements package
    ↓
Meeting 4: Sign-Off
```

### 1d. Strategic Sign-Off

> **Purpose:** Confirm we have everything before building.

#### Validation Checkpoint

- [ ] Definition Alignment Document signed off by stakeholders
- [ ] Platform selected and procurement initiated
- [ ] SLA targets defined by priority level (P1-P4 response and resolution times)
- [ ] Support channels confirmed (email, chat, help center, optional: social, phone)
- [ ] Integration scope confirmed (CRM, notification tools, engineering escalation)
- [ ] User roles and permissions agreed (Admin, Supervisor, Agent, Light Agent, Read-Only)
- [ ] Ticket taxonomy approved (categories, priorities, custom fields)
- [ ] Knowledge base content plan approved (20-30 articles)
- [ ] Rollout plan agreed (soft launch scope, full launch date)
- [ ] All critical inputs CONFIRMED (vs ASSUMED)
- [ ] No blockers for engineering

#### Decision Point

- **Proceed to Engineering** → Requirements signed off, platform procured, ready to build
- **Loop back to Strategy** → Stakeholder disagreement on SLAs, platform, or scope (rare — address in alignment loop)

> This project always proceeds to Engineering. The support platform is the deliverable — there is no natural exit point after Phase 1.

---

## Phase 2: Engineering

### 2d. QA / Test + Sign-Off

> **Purpose:** Verify the entire system works end-to-end and get customer approval.

**Two types of testing:**

| Type              | Who      | Purpose                                                 |
| ----------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Technical Testing | Our team | Verify it works (channels, routing, SLAs, integrations) |
| Customer Testing  | Customer | Verify it does what they need (real-world scenarios)     |

**Technical testing checklist:**

- [ ] Email channel: send test email → ticket created → routed correctly → SLA timer starts
- [ ] Chat channel: initiate chat → ticket created → agent receives → offline handling works
- [ ] Help center: search for article → article loads → feedback mechanism works
- [ ] Routing: submit tickets of each type → each routes to correct group
- [ ] VIP routing: submit ticket from high-value customer → routes to senior agent
- [ ] SLA: create P1 ticket → SLA timer displays correct target → breach warning fires at 75%
- [ ] Automations: inactive ticket → auto-close fires after 7 days → customer notified
- [ ] Macros: apply each macro → correct response inserted, correct fields updated
- [ ] CRM integration: create ticket → customer data displays in sidebar → activity logged in CRM
- [ ] Notification integration: create P1 ticket → notification posts to correct channel
- [ ] Engineering escalation: click "Escalate to Engineering" → issue created with correct fields
- [ ] Help center: navigate all categories → articles load → search returns relevant results
- [ ] AI bot (if enabled): initiate chat → bot suggests article → handoff to human works

**Customer testing:**

- Walk customer's support lead through a day-in-the-life scenario
- Have them process 5-10 sample tickets across different types and priorities
- Test the CRM sidebar with real customer records
- Review the help center as an end-customer would
- Capture feedback, fix issues before sign-off

**Engineering sign-off checkpoint:**

- [ ] All channels operational and creating tickets
- [ ] Routing rules verified across all ticket types
- [ ] SLA policies active with correct timers
- [ ] All integrations syncing correctly (CRM, notifications, engineering escalation)
- [ ] Help center live with 20-30 articles
- [ ] All automations and macros tested
- [ ] Customer has tested and approved
- [ ] Ready for enablement

**Decision point:**

- **Proceed to Enablement** → System built, all tests passing, ready for training
- **Loop back to Build** → Issues found, routing incorrect, integration not syncing

---

## Phase 3: Enablement

> **Goal:** Support team can actually use the system. Staged rollout validates configuration before full launch.
>
> **Output:** Trained team with documentation, system tested in production with real tickets, stable and ready for full customer base.

- [ ] 3-week hypercare period complete
- [ ] SLA compliance above target (or improving trend documented)
- [ ] No critical issues outstanding
- [ ] Support team operating without daily implementation team involvement
- [ ] Ready for handoff

**Decision point:**

- **Proceed to Handoff** → System stable, team enabled, metrics trending positively
- **Extend Hypercare** → SLA compliance below 80%, critical issues unresolved, team not yet confident

---

## Phase 4: Handoff

> **Goal:** Clean project close with maintenance plan established and retention/expansion path set.
>
> **Output:** Maintenance schedule documented, internal context transferred, customer owns the system, project archived, future revenue path established.

**Structure:**

**Maintenance ownership by engagement type:**

| Engagement Type               | Who Owns Maintenance | Handed Off At                                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Single Project**            | Customer owns        | 4c (External Handoff) — customer receives maintenance schedule and runs it themselves |
| **Dedicated (Multi-Project)** | Architect owns       | 4b (Internal Handoff) — Architect receives maintenance schedule and runs it for customer |

---

### 4a. Maintenance Schedule

> **Purpose:** Document what needs ongoing attention after the project is complete — cadences, tasks, triggers for re-engagement.

#### Standard Maintenance Framework

**Monthly Tasks:**

| Monthly Task                 | What to Check                                          | Red Flag Threshold                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| SLA Compliance Review        | % of tickets meeting FRT and resolution SLA targets    | Below 85% compliance for any priority level         |
| CSAT Score Check             | Rolling 30-day CSAT average                            | Drop of 5+ points from baseline                     |
| Automation Effectiveness     | Auto-close rate, auto-tagging accuracy, macro usage    | Auto-close causing customer complaints              |
| Ticket Volume Trends         | Month-over-month volume by category                    | >25% spike in any category (indicates product issue)|
| Knowledge Base Gap Analysis  | Top unanswered questions, articles with low helpfulness| Top 3 ticket categories have no corresponding article |

**Quarterly Tasks:**

| Quarterly Task                    | What to Review                                        | Action if Off-Track                                  |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Full Platform Audit               | User roles, permissions, groups — any stale accounts?  | Remove inactive users, update permissions             |
| Integration Health Check          | CRM sync accuracy, notification routing, escalation workflow | Re-authenticate connections, fix field mapping drift |
| SLA Target Reassessment           | Are current SLA targets still appropriate?              | Tighten targets if consistently exceeding, loosen if unrealistic |
| Automation Rule Review            | Are existing automations still relevant?                | Remove obsolete rules, add new based on ticket patterns |
| Knowledge Base Content Refresh    | Articles still accurate? New features covered?          | Update outdated articles, create new for product changes |
| CSAT Trend Analysis               | 90-day trend, satisfaction by channel and category      | Investigate categories with below-average CSAT        |

**After First Business Cycle (30-60 days post-launch):**

- Ticket deflection rate measurement: What % of inquiries are resolved via help center before ticket creation? Target: 20-30% [2]
- First response time validation: Are agents meeting SLA targets consistently? Compare to pre-launch baseline
- Channel distribution analysis: Which channels drive the most volume? Does staffing match?
- Key Question: Is the support team handling more volume without additional headcount? The target is 2x volume capacity [4]

**Refinement Triggers (when to re-engage):**

| Trigger                          | Threshold                                  | Response                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| SLA compliance drop              | Below 80% for 2+ consecutive weeks         | Re-engage — review routing, staffing, SLA targets        |
| CSAT decline                     | 10+ point drop sustained over 30 days      | Scope optimization project — root cause analysis         |
| Ticket volume spike              | >50% increase sustained over 2+ weeks      | Review for product issues, add KB articles, adjust staffing |
| Integration failure              | CRM/notification/escalation sync broken for 24+ hours | Escalate to platform vendor support             |
| Knowledge base stale             | >30% of articles not updated in 6 months   | Scope KB refresh project                                  |

**Every 6-12 Months:**

- Full system recalibration: Review all SLA targets, routing rules, automations against actual performance data
- Platform feature review: Evaluate new platform features (AI capabilities, analytics upgrades) for adoption
- Vendor contract review: Assess licensing costs vs. usage, evaluate upgrade or migration options
- Support process maturity assessment: Has the team outgrown the current configuration?

---

### 4b. Internal Handoff (SME → Architect)

> **Purpose:** Transfer context so Architect can manage ongoing relationship.

**What the Architect needs to know:**

- What was built: Platform, channels, integrations, key configuration decisions and rationale
- Customer context: Key stakeholders (VP CS, Head of Support, Support Lead), communication preferences, historical pain points
- Performance baselines: First-launch SLA metrics, CSAT baseline, ticket volume baseline
- Common issues: Typical agent questions, known platform quirks, integration edge cases

**Escalation guidelines:**

| Issue Type                                   | Who Handles  | Example                                          |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Agent training, minor macro updates          | Architect    | "How do I add a new macro for password resets?"   |
| Reporting questions, dashboard interpretation | Architect   | "What does this CSAT trend mean?"                 |
| Routing logic changes, SLA policy updates     | SME          | "We need to add a new priority level"             |
| New integration (new tool connection)         | SME          | "We want to connect our billing system"           |
| Platform migration or upgrade                 | SME          | "We're considering moving between platforms"      |

**For Dedicated engagements:** Architect also receives the maintenance schedule (4a) and becomes responsible for executing monthly and quarterly tasks. SME walks Architect through each task during handoff.

---

### 4c. External Handoff (Implementation Team → Customer)

> **Purpose:** Formal project completion with customer.

**Final project meeting (60 min):**

| Time  | Topic                              | Details                                               |
| ----- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 0-10  | Review what was delivered          | Platform, channels, integrations, help center, reports |
| 10-25 | Walk through documentation package | Admin runbook, agent guide, integration architecture   |
| 25-40 | Maintenance schedule walkthrough   | Monthly/quarterly tasks, red flag thresholds, triggers |
| 40-50 | Answer final questions             | Address any outstanding concerns                       |
| 50-55 | Confirm project complete           | Explicit: "Project is complete"                        |
| 55-60 | Schedule 30-day check-in           | Optimization review after first business cycle         |

**Documentation package delivered:**

- All training recordings (agent, supervisor, admin, leadership)
- Agent Quick-Reference Guide
- Admin Runbook (common admin tasks with step-by-step instructions)
- Integration Architecture Map
- SLA Policy Document
- Definition Alignment Document (final version)
- FAQ Document
- Troubleshooting Guide (see below)
- **Maintenance Schedule** (for Single Project engagements)

**Troubleshooting Guide (included in documentation package):**

| Scenario                            | Symptoms                                               | Resolution                                                              |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Email tickets not creating          | Emails to support@ not appearing in platform           | Check email forwarding rules, verify DNS records, test with simple email |
| Chat widget not loading             | Widget doesn't appear on website/app                   | Verify embed code, check for JavaScript conflicts, test incognito mode  |
| CRM data not showing in sidebar     | Agent sidebar shows "No data" for known customers      | Re-authenticate CRM connection, verify field mapping, check sync logs    |
| SLA timers not starting             | Tickets show no SLA policy applied                     | Verify SLA policies are active, check business hours config, match priority |
| Notifications not posting           | P1 tickets not appearing in alert channel              | Re-authenticate integration, verify channel mapping, check notification rules |
| Engineering issues not creating     | "Escalate to Engineering" doesn't create ticket        | Re-authenticate connection, verify project mapping, check field requirements |
| Auto-close firing on active tickets | Tickets closing while customer is still waiting         | Adjust auto-close rules to check for agent response, not just time elapsed |
| Routing to wrong group              | Billing tickets going to Technical team                | Review trigger conditions, check keyword routing rules, verify tag logic  |
| CSAT surveys not sending            | No satisfaction surveys after ticket resolution         | Verify survey trigger is active, check that it fires on "Solved" not "Closed" |
| Help center search returning nothing| Customer searches return 0 results for common queries  | Re-index help center, add search synonyms, verify articles are published  |

**For Single Project engagements:** Walk the customer through the maintenance schedule in detail. Record a video walkthrough of the walkthrough. Make sure they understand what to check, how often, and when to re-engage.

**Output:** Customer owns the system. Project formally complete.

### 4d. Project Close

> **Purpose:** Clean internal wrap-up + establish retention/expansion path.

#### Archive Checklist

- [ ] All project artifacts saved (requirements doc, tech spec, training recordings, admin runbook)
- [ ] Handoff documentation complete and delivered to customer
- [ ] Project status updated in tracking system
- [ ] Time/billing finalized

#### Internal Debrief (Optional but Recommended)

- What went well? (e.g., CRM integration went smoothly, agent training was well-received)
- What would we do differently? (e.g., should have pushed harder on knowledge base content during strategy)
- Any learnings to feed back into SOPs? (e.g., new macro template, better intake form question)

#### Retention / Expansion

**Two paths based on engagement type:**

| Engagement Type               | Path                         |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Single Project**            | Upsell → Downsell → Retry    |
| **Multi-Project (Dedicated)** | Schedule Refinement Check-In |

**Single Project Path:**

```
1. Upsell: Managed Services (ongoing optimization, KB expansion, reporting)
   ↓ if no
2. Downsell: Knowledge base expansion project, AI chatbot enhancement, or advanced analytics setup
   ↓ if yes
3. Retry retainer at end of next project cycle
```

**Script:**

> "Now that your support system is live, there are two ways we can continue working together. Option 1: We can set you up on managed services where we handle ongoing optimization — SLA tuning, knowledge base expansion, new integration connections, and monthly performance reviews. Option 2: If there's a specific enhancement you need, like expanding your AI chatbot or adding advanced analytics, we can scope that as a project. Which sounds more interesting?"

**Multi-Project (Dedicated) Path:**

Schedule a refinement check-in at handoff:

> "On [date ~8 weeks out], we'll review how the support system is performing — SLA compliance, CSAT trends, ticket deflection rates — and see if any adjustments are needed."

**Internal prep (2 weeks before check-in):**

| Step                | What Happens                                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Get pinged       | System reminder: refinement check-in in 2 weeks                    |
| 2. Review metrics   | Pull SLA compliance, CSAT, ticket volume, deflection rate           |
| 3. Decide ownership | Can Architect handle this check-in, or need SME?                    |
| 4. Prep materials   | If SME needed, brief them. If Architect, prep talking points with metrics. |

**At the refinement check-in:**

- Review SLA compliance against targets
- Analyze CSAT trends (B2B SaaS companies average 68% CSAT — how does client compare?) [5]
- Assess ticket deflection rate (target: 20-30% via self-service) [2]
- If minor adjustments: Architect handles (macro updates, KB article additions)
- If major changes needed: Scope new project (workflow redesign, new integration, platform migration)

**Output:** Project archived. Future revenue path established. Ready for next engagement.

| **Phase 4: Handoff**     | Independent customer + archived project                                | Internal/external handoffs complete, maintenance plan in place, project closed |

### Project Profile

This is a **technical-heavy** project:

| Phase Weight    | Percentage | Rationale                                                     |
| --------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Strategy        | 20-25%     | Requirements gathering, platform selection, SLA definition     |
| Engineering     | 50-60%     | Platform config, integrations, automations, knowledge base     |
| Enablement      | 15-20%     | Agent training, staged rollout, hypercare                      |
| Handoff         | 5-10%      | Documentation, maintenance schedule, project close             |

### Key Industry Context

- B2B SaaS companies spend approximately 8-8.5% of ARR on support and success functions [5]
- 91% of customers would use a help center, and 76% prefer self-service over contacting support [2]
- Companies with AI-driven support achieve 25-45% ticket deflection and 2-5x ROI within the first year [2]
- The average cost of a B2B support agent interaction exceeds $13, while self-service costs pennies per interaction — making knowledge base investment directly tied to cost savings [4]
- Top-performing B2B SaaS companies achieve average first response time under 1 hour for email and under 2 minutes for live chat [3]
- Customer satisfaction drops sharply when response times exceed 8-12 hours, making SLA enforcement critical to CSAT outcomes [3]
- First-contact resolution improvements reduce churn by up to 67% [5]
- Organizations implementing AI-powered support see $3.50 return for every $1 invested [5]
