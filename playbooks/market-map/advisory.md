# Market Map — Advisory

Market Map - ICP & Persona Definition with Data Enrichment

## 1) Project Overview

### What is the name of this project?

Market Map - ICP & Persona Definition with Data Enrichment

### What is the purpose of this project?

Define client's ICP and Personas, then enrich and load their Total Addressable Market (TAM) into CRM with tiering, valuation, and contact data. Creates a framework for outbound outreach, lead routing, and territory design. (Note: Market Map creates inputs for territory design, but actual territory assignment is a separate project.)

**The core transformation:** Your ICP goes from a document sitting in a Google Doc to infrastructure loaded into your CRM, powering your dashboards, telling your team where to focus. This is what it looks like when ICP is infrastructure — it powers everything downstream.

### What Market Map Unlocks

✅ All accounts from your TAM in CRM with propensity scoring

✅ All target personas at those accounts

✅ Account valuations for territory design

✅ Foundation for real-time signals on accounts that matter

| Before                | After                       |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| "Who should I call?"  | Filter T1 + Tier 1 personas |
| Manual lead routing   | Automatic routing by tier   |
| Arbitrary territories | Equitable valuation per rep |
| Enrich everything     | Enrich only ICP             |
| Signals lost in noise | T1 signals surfaced instantly |

**Signals become actionable once you have Market Map:**
- When a T1 account posts a job for a role your product supports — you see it
- When a T1 account's competitor just made a move — you see it
- When a T1 account hits a buying trigger — your rep knows about it that day

Market Map is the foundation for signals, ABM, and territory design.

### The Clay Use Case Pyramid

At LeanScale, we view Clay through what we call the "Clay Use Case Pyramid." There are 4 primary use cases for the platform, and Market Map sits at the base — the foundation that everything else relies on.

**Why Market Map is the foundation:**

When you build your Market Map first, it becomes the infrastructure that all other Clay workflows reference:

- **Automated inbound flows** check the Market Map to see if a lead is at a T1 account before spending credits on enrichment
- **Automated outbound systems** reference the Market Map to know who to target
- **Signal workflows** (job changes, intent triggers, competitor moves) filter against the Market Map to prioritize T1 accounts

Without Market Map, you're burning credits in silos — re-enriching the same accounts across different workflows, enriching accounts that don't matter, with no single source of truth.

With Market Map, every other Clay use case becomes more efficient because it has a tiered, valued account foundation to build on.

### What business outcomes does this project drive?

**Primary Outcomes:**

- Better territory design (equitable sales territories based on actual account value)
- Cleaner lead routing (near-instant routing based on fit score)
- Higher marketing conversion rates (segment audiences by tier for more focused targeting)
- Automated outbound at scale
- Smarter Clay credit and budget management (focus enrichment only on ICP accounts)
- Better targeting on intent signal data (cut down noise, prioritize hotter accounts more surgically)

**Secondary Outcomes:**

- Existing account expansion visibility (compare where accounts could be vs where they are - identifies upsell potential)
- Data visibility for bottoms-up and top-down capacity planning (validate quotas against actual TAM - e.g., if quotas require 750 Fortune 500 companies but only 500 exist)
- Foundation for all Clay signals use-cases

### Who in the Org can benefit from this project?

CRO, VP Sales, VP Marketing, Head of RevOps, RevOps Manager, Sales Leadership, Marketing Leadership

### Pain Points this Project Solves

Market Map is foundational infrastructure — it creates the data layer that enables multiple downstream capabilities. The specific pain it solves depends on what you're trying to unlock:

| Pain Point                                                                                     | What Market Map Enables                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No systematic ICP definition                                                                   | Enrichable, scoreable ICP criteria that automation can apply at scale                                |
| Enriching wrong accounts and wasting Clay credits                                              | Focus enrichment only on ICP-qualified accounts                                                      |
| Time spent on wrong leads (not dead leads — wrong fit based on technographics, industry, etc.) | Tier-based prioritization so reps know who to call                                                   |
| Inability to do signals-based outreach                                                         | Foundation for all Clay signals use-cases — you need to know WHO to target before you can act on signals |
| Marketing struggling to segment audiences                                                      | Tier-based segmentation for focused targeting                                                        |
| Sales territories designed arbitrarily                                                         | Account valuation enables equitable territory design (see Gold Miner Metaphor below)                 |

### The Data Behind the Problem

These pain points aren't theoretical. Research from the 2025 FullCast report (co-published with LeanScale) analyzed 440,000 opportunities worth $43 billion and found:

- **Only 23% of pipeline actually fits ICP** — meaning 77% of the deals in pipeline are wrong fit
- **Wrong-fit deals are 8x harder to close** — sales cycles are longer, win rates are lower
- **77% of sellers missed quota in 2025** — even after companies cut quotas by 13%
- **63% of CROs admit they have little or no confidence in their own ICP definition**

The problem isn't that companies don't have an ICP — it's that the ICP isn't operationalized. It's not in the CRM. It's not powering automations. Sales and marketing can't actually use it.

**Market Map solves this.** It takes your ICP from a document sitting somewhere to infrastructure powering your systems.

### The Gold Miner Metaphor

*Use this metaphor when explaining the territory design benefit specifically. It does not apply to other Market Map use cases.*

Imagine you have three experienced miners sent to mine gold from three different mountains. You assign one miner per mountain.

- **Miner 1** comes back with a couple of gold nuggets. You blame him for not mining hard enough.
- **Miner 2** comes back with a wheelbarrow full of gold. You praise him and send him back.
- **Miner 3** comes back with a train-load of gold. You promote him to President's Club.

But here's the question: **Why didn't you figure out how much gold was in each mountain FIRST?**

This is exactly what happens in sales territory design. Organizations assign reps to territories without knowing the actual value in each.

**Market Map solves this.** Before assigning territories, we:

1. Identify every account in your TAM
2. Valuate each account (estimate potential ARR)
3. Tier accounts by fit and potential value
4. THEN design territories with data on where the "gold" is

### Target Motion: SLG B2B

Market Map is centered on SLG (Sales-Led Growth) B2B companies. PLG (Product-Led Growth) companies may have market mapping needs, but it would be closer to B2C market research - a fundamentally different approach that we're not equipped for in this project scope.

### Common Belief Barriers

**"We already have our ICP"** — You probably have pieces, but now you're building it "the Clay Way": every criterion must be enrichable through data providers, and you're creating a point-based fit score that automation can apply at scale. You're operationalizing what was previously tribal knowledge.

**"Does this have to be a big project?"** — No. T1 Only approach takes 2-3 weeks with 500-2k accounts. Quick wins: dead lead resurrection, CRM cleanup, single segment focus.

**"Can't we skip to Clay tables?"** — If you enrich without defining ICP first, you're burning credits on accounts that don't matter and your reps still won't know who to call. The sequence matters: ICP Matrix → Valuation → Fit Score → THEN enrichment.

## 4) Scoping

### Scoping Factors

**1. Company Type (Vertical vs Horizontal)**

- Vertical companies → Pull full TAM, easier to define clear ICP boundaries
- Horizontal companies → T1 only approach, need very restrictive criteria

**2. TAM Size**

- &lt;100k accounts → Full TAM pull feasible
- 500k+ accounts → Tiered approach (T1/T2/T3)
- Millions of accounts → T1 only mandatory

**3. Sales Team Size**

- 1-3 reps → T1 only (500-2k accounts)
- 5-10 reps → T1/T2 pull (2,500-10k accounts)
- 10+ reps → Full TAM pull viable if vertical

**4. Company Stage & Historical Data**

- Early stage (&lt;50 customers) → Approach 6 (No Historical Data)
- Series A/B (100-500 customers) → Approach 5 (Historical Data Heavy)
- Series C+ (500+ customers) → Robust data analysis

**5. CRM Data Quality**

- Clean CRM → Standard approach
- Messy CRM → Approach 4 (CRM Cleanup First)
- No CRM → Net-new only

**6. Data Provider Coverage**

- Standard B2B SaaS → Apollo, Clearbit
- Nonprofits/Associations → Cause IQ required
- Financial Services → iBanknet required
- Healthcare → Definitive Healthcare
- Education → IPEDS data

**7. Product Pricing Model**

- Per-seat → Employee headcount coefficient
- Usage-based → Revenue coefficient
- Enterprise deals → Like accounts comparison
- Tiered packages → Combination approach

**8. Renewal/Churn Rates by Segment**

- If certain verticals have significantly higher churn (e.g., tech churns 3x vs financial services), factor this into ICP scoring
- Deprioritize verticals where you get displaced frequently, even if they close initially

**9. Existing GTM Motion**

- Outbound-heavy → Full contact enrichment (3-5 contacts per T1 account)
- Inbound-led → Lighter contact enrichment (1-2 contacts per account)
- PLG motion → Incorporate product signals into fit scoring

**10. Territory Design Urgency**

- Hiring new reps soon → Need precise territory valuation
- Existing territories stable → Can phase rollout

**11. Clay Credit Budget**

- Unlimited credits → Enrich aggressively
- Limited credits (5k-10k) → T1 only (Approach 3)

**12. Technical Complexity of ICP Criteria**

- Simple firmographics → Fast build (1-2 days)
- Complex custom criteria → Slower build (3-5 days)

**13. Stakeholder Alignment Level**

- Strong ICP alignment → 3 meeting approach
- Misaligned stakeholders → 5 meeting approach with refinement call

**14. Speed to Market Need**

- Urgent (launching outbound campaign next month) → T1 only (Approach 3), 3-week sprint
- Strategic (building foundation for next year) → Full TAM (Approach 1), 6-week build

**Other Factors:**

- Existing tools (ZoomInfo/Apollo exports, intent data providers)
- Data privacy regulations (GDPR-heavy regions)
- Multi-product portfolio
- Channel/partner motion
- Account-Based Marketing maturity

### Multiple Approaches

**Approach 1: Full TAM Pull (Vertical Company with Narrow TAM)**

- Criteria: Company targets specific vertical (e.g., nonprofits with 10+ board members, financial services with $500M+ AUM), TAM is &lt;100k accounts, sales team of 5+ reps
- Execution: Pull entire TAM into Clay → Enrich all → Tier all → Load all into CRM

**Approach 2: Tiered Pull Only (Horizontal or Large TAM)**

- Criteria: Horizontal product (any company could be customer), TAM is 500k+ accounts, smaller sales team (1-3 reps)
- Execution: Define T1/T2/T3 criteria → Pull only T1 initially (50-10k accounts per rep max) → Enrich → Load → Expand to T2/T3 later

**Approach 3: T1 Only (Minimum Viable Market Map)**

- Criteria: Small team, limited budget, want quick wins, clear T1 definition
- Execution: Define T1 criteria very tightly → Pull 50-1k accounts → Enrich → Load → Validate over 1 sales cycle → Expand later

**Approach 4: CRM Cleanup First**

- Criteria: CRM has garbage data, domains not normalized, duplicate accounts, tiering exists but wrong
- Execution: Audit current CRM → Export accounts → Clean domains in Clay → Match Clay search to CRM → Enrich only gaps → Reload with clean data

**Approach 5: Historical Data Heavy**

- Criteria: Client has 200+ closed won/lost, robust firmographic data in CRM, mature sales org
- Execution: Start with correlation analysis on closed won/lost → Let data inform ICP criteria → Validate hypothesis with stakeholder interviews → Build ICP matrix from data insights

**Approach 6: No Historical Data**

- Criteria: Early stage (&lt;50 customers), limited closed lost tracking, sparse CRM data
- Execution: Rely heavily on stakeholder interviews, use Clay Searcher for validation in real-time during workshops, use LeanScale ICP Explorer microapp for hypothesis generation, emphasize refinement cycle

## 5) Discovery Questions

### Questions for Project Kickoff

**Business Context:**

- How many sales reps do you have? (informs target list size: 50-10k accounts per rep for T1)
- Do you have historical closed won/closed lost data? (need 100+ customers or 200+ total closed won/lost for correlation analysis)
- What's your current sales cycle length? (informs refinement timeline - typically 30-90 days)
- Are you vertical or horizontal? (horizontal = don't pull full TAM, focus on tiers only)

**ICP Clarity:**

- Do you already have ICP documentation? (belief barrier - need to redo it "the Clay Way" even if exists)
- What geographies do you primarily do business in?
- What industries or verticals are you targeting?
- Do you have any technographic requirements? (e.g., must use Salesforce, Office365)

**CRM State:**

- What CRM are you using? (Salesforce, HubSpot, etc)
- How clean is your CRM data? (especially domains - need normalized domains for matching)
- Do you already have accounts loaded? Are they tiered?
- Do you have custom fields for ICP criteria already created?

**Data & Tools:**

- Do you have Clay already? What's your credit situation?
- What data providers do you currently use? (may have Cause IQ, iBanknet, etc)
- Have you already done any correlation analysis on your historical data?

**Expectations:**

- What would success look like for this project?
- How quickly do you need this completed?
- Who are the stakeholders who need to be involved? (sales, marketing, leadership)

| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| How many sales reps do you have?           | 1-3 = T1 only, 5-10 = Tiered, 10+ = Full TAM if vertical                                      |
| What's your total addressable market size? | &lt;100k = Full TAM, 500k+ = Tiered, Millions = T1 only                                          |
| Are you vertical or horizontal?            | Vertical = Full TAM feasible, Horizontal = T1 only                                            |

| Is sales/marketing aligned on ICP?         | Aligned = 3 meetings, Misaligned = 5 meetings with refinement                                 |

---

## 6) Overcoming Common Belief Barriers

#### "We Already Have Our ICP"

You're now doing it **"the Clay Way."** This matters because:

1. **Access to new data.** Clay enables scoring on criteria that were impossible to validate before.
1. **Enrichable ICP.** Every criterion must be answerable through data providers—not just a Google Doc.
1. **Systematic scoring.** Moving from "we know T1 when we see it" to a point-based fit score.

**The reframe:** "You may have SOME of it—that's fine, we'll move faster. But we need to re-engineer it based on what Clay can actually enrich and score systematically."

#### "Does This Have to Be a Big Project?"

Market Map can be big OR a series of smaller wins:

| Approach | Timeline | Scope |
|----------|----------|-------|
| T1 Only (Minimum) | 2-3 weeks | 500-2k accounts |
| Tiered Pull | 4-6 weeks | T1/T2 now, T3 later |
| Full TAM | 6-8 weeks | Complete market coverage |

**Quick wins:** Dead lead resurrection, CRM cleanup, single segment focus.

#### "Can't We Just Skip to Clay Tables?"

If you enrich without defining ICP first:

- You're burning credits on accounts that don't matter
- You have no scoring logic to apply
- Your reps still won't know who to call

**The sequence matters:** ICP Matrix → Valuation Methodology → Fit Score → THEN Clay enrichment
