# Event Operations: Lead List Intake Process — Advisory

Event Operations Lead List Intake Process - Standardizing how event-generated leads are captured, validated, deduplicated, and routed into CRM/MAP for timely follow-up

---

## 1) Project Overview

### What is the name of this project?

Event Operations Lead List Intake Process - Post-Event Lead Ingestion and Routing Automation

### What is the purpose of this project?

This project builds a repeatable, automated intake process that moves event-generated leads (trade shows, webinars, conferences, networking sessions) from capture to CRM in under 24 hours, with proper source tagging, deduplication, and routing to the right rep or nurture track. The client gains a standardized pipeline that replaces manual CSV wrangling, eliminates duplicate records, and makes event ROI measurable for the first time.

**Core transformation:** From "event leads sit in spreadsheets for days and arrive in CRM dirty and unattributed" to "event leads flow into CRM within 24 hours, deduplicated, source-tagged, and routed to the right owner with campaign attribution intact."

### What Event Operations Lead List Intake Process Unlocks

After this project is complete, the organization can:

- **Measure event ROI with real data** -- every event lead connects to a campaign, enabling cost-per-lead and conversion-by-event reporting
- **Follow up on event leads within 24 hours** instead of the typical 5-7 day delay that kills conversion
- **Import leads from any event platform** (Cvent, Eventbrite, Splash, ON24) using standardized templates that map fields automatically
- **Eliminate duplicate records from events** by running pre-import deduplication and matching against existing CRM records
- **Route hot leads immediately** -- demo requests and pricing conversations from events trigger real-time alerts to assigned reps

| Before                                                      | After                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Event leads sit in spreadsheets for 5-7+ days post-event    | Leads in CRM within 24 hours of event close                  |
| Manual CSV uploads with inconsistent formatting              | Standardized import templates with built-in validation       |
| 30-45% duplicate rate on event list imports [1]              | Pre-import deduplication drops duplicate rate below 5%        |
| No campaign attribution -- event ROI is guesswork            | Every lead tied to campaign ID with source/sub-source tags   |
| Sales doesn't know which leads came from events              | Hot lead alerts and clear event context in CRM records       |
| Marketing and sales argue over event lead ownership          | Automated assignment rules based on territory and account ownership |

### What business outcomes does this project drive?

**Primary Outcomes:**

- Event lead-to-CRM time drops from 5+ days to under 24 hours, putting leads in front of reps while interest is fresh
- Duplicate rate on event imports drops from 30-45% to under 5%, reducing sales confusion and wasted outreach
- Event campaign attribution becomes accurate, enabling cost-per-lead and ROI-per-event reporting for the first time
- Sales follow-up compliance becomes measurable with speed-to-lead tracking by rep and event

**Secondary Outcomes:**

- Foundation for event ROI optimization -- once you can measure which events produce pipeline, you can reallocate budget to the highest-performing events
- Enables event lead scoring integration -- clean, attributed event leads can feed into existing lead scoring models (see Methodology for lead processing frameworks)
- Sales and marketing alignment improves as both teams share a single source of truth for event lead data

### Who in the Org can benefit from this project?

VP Marketing, Event Marketing Manager, Marketing Operations Manager, RevOps Leader, Sales Development Reps (SDRs), Account Executives, Sales Operations Manager, VP Sales

### Pain Points this Project Solves

This project is foundational infrastructure for event-driven pipeline. The specific pain it solves depends on the current state of the organization's event operations.

| Pain Point                                                        | What Event Operations Lead List Intake Process Enables          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Our event leads sit in spreadsheets for a week before anyone touches them" | Automated import workflow gets leads into CRM within 24 hours   |
| "We import the same person three times from different event lists" | Pre-import deduplication matches on email, then company+name    |
| "We can't tell which events actually generate pipeline"           | Campaign ID required on every import; attribution reports built |
| "Sales ignores event leads because they don't trust the data"     | Data validation rules enforce completeness before import        |
| "Every event platform has different field names and formats"      | Field mapping templates translate any event source to CRM schema |
| "Marketing says the event worked, sales says the leads were bad"  | Shared dashboards show intake volume, quality scores, and follow-up compliance |

### The Data Behind the Problem

The problem of slow event lead follow-up and poor data quality is well-documented across B2B organizations:

- **Speed kills (or saves) deals:** Leads contacted within 5 minutes are 100x more likely to connect and convert than those contacted later. Yet the average B2B sales team takes 42 hours to respond to a new lead [1][2]. For event leads that already have a 48-72 hour freshness window, this delay is fatal.
- **Duplicates are the norm, not the exception:** More than 45% of all new records entered into CRMs are duplicates, based on analysis of over 12 billion Salesforce records [3]. Event imports are particularly prone because the same attendee appears across badge scans, form fills, and manual entry from a single event.
- **Data quality drags everyone down:** 91% of CRM data is incomplete and 70% decays annually [4]. Approximately 40% of B2B leads are invalid, incomplete, or duplicated [3]. Sales reps waste an estimated 550 hours per year -- nearly 14 weeks -- dealing with inaccurate CRM data [3].
- **Attribution remains the biggest blind spot:** 77% of B2B marketing decision-makers report that measuring event marketing ROI is one of their greatest challenges [5]. Only 7.6% of B2B marketers use attribution methods that tie events to pipeline [6].
- **81% of trade show attendees have buying authority** [7], making event leads high-value -- but only if they reach the right rep fast with the right context.

### Key Metaphors or Frameworks

**The Leaky Bucket Metaphor:** Every event generates a bucket of leads. Without a standardized intake process, that bucket has holes -- leads leak out through delayed imports (time hole), get duplicated (overflow hole), lose their source attribution (tracking hole), or never reach the right rep (routing hole). This project plugs every hole so the full value of event investment reaches the pipeline.

**When to use it:** During executive conversations about why the event team keeps asking for more budget but can't show results. The response isn't "spend less on events" -- it's "stop losing the leads you already paid to capture."

**When NOT to use it:** Don't use this with technical stakeholders who need process specifics. They want the workflow, not the metaphor.

### Target Motion

This project fits **Sales-Led Growth (SLG)** and **hybrid SLG/PLG** companies that invest in events as a demand generation channel. It applies to both inbound-led companies running webinars and outbound-led companies attending trade shows and conferences.

Not a fit for: Companies that don't attend or host events. Companies without a CRM or MAP in place (those need platform implementation first). Pure PLG companies that rely entirely on self-serve product signups with no event marketing function.

## 2) Tools & Systems

### Primary Tools

**Salesforce (CRM)**

Primary system of record for lead/contact objects. Receives processed event leads after import, deduplication, and enrichment. Handles lead assignment rules, duplicate management, and reporting dashboards.

**HubSpot (CRM + MAP)**

For HubSpot clients, serves as both CRM and marketing automation. Handles list imports, workflows for lead processing, contact deduplication, campaign association, and lifecycle stage management.

**Marketo / Pardot (MAP)**

Marketing automation platform for lead processing workflows. Handles list imports, data normalization, lead scoring integration, campaign membership assignment, and nurture track routing.

**Event Platforms (Data Sources)**

Cvent, Eventbrite, Splash, ON24, Hopin -- source systems where event leads are initially captured. Each has different export formats and field schemas that must be mapped to CRM/MAP fields.

**Data Providers (if applicable):**

- Standard enrichment: ZoomInfo, Apollo, Clearbit -- for filling missing fields (title, phone, company size) on imported event leads
- Badge scanning: Lead retrieval apps provided by event venues (varies by event)
- Virtual events: ON24, Hopin, Zoom Webinar -- each exports attendee data differently

- Responsibilities: CRM/MAP admin access, workflow approvals, ongoing process ownership post-launch

**Event Marketing Manager (Input Provider + End User)**

- Required for: Discovery, requirements, UAT, training
- Responsibilities: Providing sample event lists, validating import templates, executing the intake process post-handoff

**Sales Operations Manager (Input Provider)**

- Required for: Discovery, assignment rule design, reporting review
- Responsibilities: Defining territory rules, follow-up SLA expectations, validating lead routing logic

**VP Sales or Sales Leadership (Input Provider)**

## 4) Scoping

### Scoping Factors

**1. Number of Event Platforms**

- 1-2 platforms (e.g., just Cvent and webinar tool) -&gt; Standard scope; 2-3 field mapping templates
- 3-5 platforms (Cvent + Eventbrite + ON24 + Splash + custom) -&gt; Extended scope; requires a mapping template per platform and more complex validation rules

**2. CRM/MAP Complexity**

- Single CRM with native MAP (HubSpot) -&gt; Simpler integration; workflows built in one system
- Salesforce + separate MAP (Marketo/Pardot) -&gt; More complex; sync logic between systems, duplicate handling in both

**3. Existing Assignment Rules**

- Territory and assignment rules already exist -&gt; Scope limited to adding event-specific routing logic
- No assignment infrastructure -&gt; Must build routing from scratch, adding 15-20 hours

**4. Event Volume and Frequency**

- 4-10 events/year -&gt; Standard process covers all scenarios
- 10+ events/year with multiple types (trade shows, webinars, roadshows) -&gt; Need differentiated intake paths by event type with different field requirements

**5. Data Privacy Requirements**

- Standard US-only operations -&gt; Basic consent tracking on import
- International events with GDPR/CCPA exposure -&gt; Requires consent field mapping, opt-in validation rules, and compliance documentation in the workflow

**6. Existing Data Quality**

- CRM data is reasonably clean (&lt;10% duplicate rate) -&gt; Standard dedup rules sufficient
- CRM data has significant quality issues (20%+ duplicate rate) -&gt; Recommend CRM deduplication project first or in parallel; event imports will compound existing problems

### Multiple Approaches

**Approach 1: Template-First (Quick Win)**

- Criteria: Client has fewer than 6 events/year, uses 1-2 event platforms, assignment rules already exist
- Execution: Build standardized import templates, basic validation rules, and campaign tagging. Manual import with automated post-processing. 40-50 hours.

**Approach 2: Full Automation**

- Criteria: Client has 10+ events/year, multiple event platforms, needs real-time routing and hot lead alerts
- Execution: Build API-connected or scheduled import automation, comprehensive dedup logic, assignment rules, alerting, and full reporting suite. 60-80 hours.

**Approach 3: Phased Rollout**

- Criteria: Client has poor data quality or no existing assignment infrastructure; needs foundation work first
- Execution: Phase 1 (templates + manual import + campaign tagging, 30 hours) followed by Phase 2 (automation + routing + reporting, 30-50 hours) after data cleanup.

## 5) Discovery Questions

### Questions for Project Kickoff

**Event Operations Context**

- How many events does your company attend or host per year? What types (trade shows, webinars, conferences, roadshows)?
- Which event platforms do you use for registration and lead capture (Cvent, Eventbrite, Splash, ON24, badge scanning apps)?
- Who currently owns the process of getting event leads into the CRM? How long does it typically take?

**Current State Assessment**

- Can you walk us through what happens to a lead list after your last trade show? From receipt to CRM entry to sales follow-up?
- What data fields do you typically receive from event platforms? How consistent is the format across events?
- What is your current duplicate rate on event imports? Do you have any dedup process before or after import?
- How do you currently tag event leads for source attribution? Is there a campaign structure in place?

**Technical Environment**

- Which CRM are you on (Salesforce, HubSpot)? Which edition/tier?
- Which MAP are you using (HubSpot, Marketo, Pardot)? Is it integrated with the CRM?
- Do you have existing lead assignment rules for territory-based routing? Are they documented?
- Are there any data privacy requirements (GDPR, CCPA) that affect how you collect and store event attendee data?

**Expectations and Constraints**

- What does "fast enough" look like for event lead follow-up? What SLA do you want for first sales touch?
- Is there an upcoming event we can use as the pilot for the new process? When?
- Are there specific reports or dashboards your leadership team wants to see for event ROI?
- Who will own and maintain this process after handoff? Do they have admin access to CRM/MAP?

### Information to Gather Before Implementation

**Event Data Samples:**

Sample lead lists from the last 2-3 events, including exports from each event platform in use. Needed to understand field schemas, data quality issues, and typical list sizes.

**CRM/MAP Access:**

Admin or near-admin credentials for Salesforce/HubSpot and MAP. Required for workflow configuration, import rule setup, and duplicate management.

**Campaign Structure:**

Current campaign hierarchy documentation (if any). If none exists, confirm stakeholder availability to design one during the project.

**Assignment Rules:**

Current territory/assignment documentation or the rules as currently configured in CRM. If building from scratch, need territory definitions from sales leadership.

**Upcoming Event Calendar:**

List of events in the next quarter with dates and platforms. Needed to prioritize which event platform integrations to build first and schedule the live pilot.

| Current CRM data quality?                                | Clean (&lt;10% dups) = any approach, Dirty (20%+) = Phased Rollout                         |
| Is there an event in the next 4-6 weeks for pilot?       | Yes = any approach, No = start with template design and delay live testing                |
| GDPR/CCPA requirements?                                  | No = standard scope, Yes = add 10-15 hours for compliance workflow                       |

## 6) Overcoming Common Belief Barriers

#### "We just need a spreadsheet template -- this doesn't require a whole project."

A template solves one piece: consistent column headers. It does not solve the five other problems that destroy event lead value. Without automation, the template still sits in someone's inbox for 3-5 days. Without dedup logic, the same attendee appears 2-3 times across badge scans, demo forms, and partner-shared lists. Without campaign ID requirements, attribution breaks. Without assignment rules, leads land in a queue nobody checks.

The real question: how much pipeline are you losing from the 5+ events you run each year because of these gaps? With 81% of trade show attendees having buying authority [7] and leads going cold within 48 hours, the cost of not automating intake is measured in lost deals.

**The reframe:** "A template is step one of a ten-step process. We build the other nine steps so the template actually produces results."

#### "Our events team already handles this."

They do -- and they spend 10+ hours per event doing it manually. They download CSVs, manually reformat columns, hand-deduplicate against CRM exports, upload to the MAP, and email sales ops to trigger assignment. That process takes 3-7 days, during which 78% of leads may go to a competitor who responded first [2].

The goal isn't to replace the events team. It's to give them a 30-minute process instead of a 10-hour process, and to get leads to sales in hours instead of days.

**The reframe:** "Your events team is great at running events. Let's free them from data processing so they can focus on what they're best at."

#### "We don't do enough events to justify this."

Even 4-6 events per year represent significant investment. A single trade show booth costs $15,000-50,000+ when you factor in sponsorship, travel, booth design, and staff time. If 20-30% of leads from those events never get proper follow-up because they arrived in CRM too late or were buried in duplicates, that's $3,000-15,000 per event in wasted spend.

The math: 5 events x $30,000 average spend x 25% lead leakage = $37,500 in unrecovered event investment annually. A 40-60 hour project at consulting rates pays for itself after the first event.

**The reframe:** "The fewer events you run, the more each one matters. Can you afford to lose 25% of leads from a $30K event?"

#### "Our CRM handles deduplication automatically."

CRM native dedup rules catch exact email matches after import, but they miss the harder cases: same person with a personal email at the event and a work email in CRM, name variations (Rob vs. Robert), or records from partner-shared lists with slightly different formatting. Over 45% of all new records entering Salesforce are duplicates [3], and event imports are among the worst offenders because leads arrive from multiple capture points at the same event.

Pre-import deduplication using fuzzy matching on email + company + name catches what CRM native rules miss. The combination of pre-import dedup plus CRM-native rules brings duplicate rates below 5%.

**The reframe:** "CRM dedup is the safety net. Pre-import dedup is the guardrail. You need both."

## 7) Metrics Impact & Success Measurement

### Power 10 Metrics Impacted

| Power 10 Metric        | Impact Direction | Expected Magnitude | Notes                                                                 |
| ----------------------- | --------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MQL Production          | Increase        | +15-25%            | Faster intake means more event leads reach MQL status before going cold |
| Pipeline Production     | Increase        | +10-20%            | Properly routed event leads with context convert to pipeline at higher rates |
| MQL-to-Opp Conversion   | Increase        | +10-15%            | Clean, attributed, timely event leads convert better than stale, duplicated ones |
| CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) | Decrease | -5-10%            | Higher conversion from existing event spend reduces effective CAC      |

### Expected Outcomes

| Metric                              | Before                  | After                    | Source              |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------- |
| Event lead-to-CRM time              | 5-7+ days               | Under 24 hours           | Raw file / industry standard |
| Duplicate rate on event imports      | 30-45%                  | Under 5%                 | Plauti CRM analysis [3] |
| Event campaign attribution accuracy  | Partial or none         | 100% (required on import)| Process enforcement  |
| Sales follow-up within 48 hours      | Ad hoc / unmeasured     | 80%+ with SLA tracking   | SLA design target   |
| Event leads with complete data fields | 40-60%                 | 90%+ (validation gates)  | Data validation rules |
| Time spent on manual event lead processing | 10+ hours/event  | Under 1 hour/event       | Automation reduction |

### How to Measure Success

**Leading Indicators (Early signals, Week 1-4):**

- Import SLA compliance: percentage of event leads loaded into CRM within 24 hours of event close
- Duplicate rate on imports: should drop below 5% on first automated import
- Data completeness score: percentage of imported leads with all required fields populated
- Campaign association rate: 100% of event leads should have campaign ID assigned

**Lagging Indicators (Proof of success, Month 2-6):**

- Event lead-to-SQL conversion rate increase of 15%+ compared to pre-project baseline
- Speed-to-first-touch by sales reps: median time from CRM entry to first outreach
- Event ROI reporting accuracy: ability to report cost-per-lead and pipeline-per-event for each event
- Sales team satisfaction with event lead quality (qualitative feedback from SDRs and AEs)
- Reduction in marketing-sales friction over event lead ownership and follow-up
