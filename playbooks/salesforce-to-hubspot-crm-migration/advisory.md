# Salesforce-to-HubSpot CRM Migration — Advisory

## 1) Project Overview

### What is the name of this project?

Salesforce to HubSpot CRM Migration - CRM Platform Consolidation &amp; Cost Optimization

### What is the purpose of this project?

This project migrates all CRM data, processes, workflows, automations, and integrations from Salesforce to HubSpot, delivering a unified platform where sales, marketing, and service operate from a single system of record. The client ends up with a fully operational HubSpot CRM containing clean migrated data, rebuilt workflows, configured reporting, trained users, and a decommissioned Salesforce instance.

**Core transformation:** From a fragmented, high-cost CRM environment where marketing and sales operate in separate systems with inconsistent data -- to a unified, lower-cost platform with full cross-functional visibility and the ability to trace revenue back to specific marketing activities.

### What Salesforce to HubSpot CRM Migration Unlocks

After this project is complete, the client can:

- Track closed deals back to the originating marketing campaign and specific touchpoints
- Run a single pipeline view across sales, marketing, and CS without cross-system reconciliation
- Reduce CRM administration burden by moving to a platform where reps spend less time on data entry
- Eliminate duplicate license costs from running parallel CRM and marketing automation systems
- Give every team member real-time access to the same customer record without integration lag

| Before | After |
| ------ | ----- |
| Marketing in HubSpot, Sales in Salesforce -- no shared view | Unified CRM with all teams on one platform |
| $150-300/user/month Salesforce licenses plus add-ons | 30-50% reduction in total CRM spend [1] |
| Sales reps spending 70% of time on admin tasks [2] | Faster CRM with higher ease-of-use scores (8.4 vs 7.2 on G2) [3] |
| Reports requiring manual cross-system data pulls | Native reporting across marketing, sales, and service |
| 3rd-party integrations needed for basic marketing attribution | Built-in attribution reporting connecting campaigns to revenue |
| Dedicated Salesforce admin required for ongoing maintenance | Lower admin overhead with native workflow builder |

### What business outcomes does this project drive?

**Primary Outcomes:**

- **30-50% reduction in total CRM spend** by consolidating Salesforce licenses, add-ons, AppExchange apps, and premium support costs onto HubSpot [1]
- **Higher user adoption rates** -- HubSpot's ease of setup scores 8.4 vs Salesforce's 7.2 across thousands of G2 reviews, and 81% of HubSpot users report high CRM adoption [3]
- **Full marketing-to-sales attribution** -- the ability to trace closed-won deals back to originating campaigns within 90 days of go-live
- **Clean, unified data** -- a single customer record across departments with less than 5% duplicate rate post-migration

**Secondary Outcomes:**

- Foundation for advanced HubSpot capabilities (AI-powered sales tools, predictive lead scoring, content intelligence)
- Reduced dependency on specialized Salesforce administrators and developers
- Faster onboarding of new hires to CRM (36 days average HubSpot activation vs months for Salesforce customization) [3]
- Ability to run integrated inbound and outbound motions from one platform

### Who in the Org can benefit from this project?

VP of Revenue Operations, VP Sales, VP Marketing, Head of Sales Operations, Sales Managers, SDR/BDR Team, Account Executives, Customer Success Managers, Marketing Operations Manager, IT/Systems Administrator

### Pain Points this Project Solves

The migration is foundational infrastructure that eliminates system fragmentation. The specific pain it solves depends on which department is feeling the friction most.

| Pain Point | What Salesforce to HubSpot CRM Migration Enables |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| "We're paying $150-300/user/month and half our team barely uses it" | Consolidated platform at lower cost with higher adoption rates |
| "Marketing lives in HubSpot but sales is in Salesforce -- we can't see the full picture" | Single system of record with native marketing-sales alignment |
| "Our sales reps spend more time updating Salesforce than selling" | Simpler UX that reduces administrative burden -- reps gain 3-5 hours/week [4] |
| "We need a dedicated Salesforce admin just to keep things running" | Lower maintenance overhead; HubSpot's native tools reduce admin dependency |
| "We can't tell which marketing campaigns actually drive revenue" | Built-in multi-touch attribution connecting campaigns to closed deals |
| "Every new integration or automation requires a Salesforce developer" | No-code/low-code workflow builder accessible to ops teams without Apex skills |
| "Our data is a mess -- duplicates everywhere, fields half-filled" | Migration forces a data cleanup that improves quality across the board |

### The Data Behind the Problem

The case for migration is backed by clear patterns in CRM usage and cost data:

- **CRM adoption remains a top challenge:** 20-70% of CRM projects fail, primarily due to poor user adoption [5]. Only 40% of businesses claim a 90%+ CRM adoption rate [6]. Salesforce's complexity is a key driver -- 83% of senior executives report ongoing resistance to CRM usage among staff [6].
- **Sales productivity is consumed by admin work:** Sales reps spend only 29% of their workweek on actual selling activities. The remaining 71% goes to administrative work, data entry, and preparation [2]. Data handling and preparation alone account for 54% of the workweek -- over 21 hours per rep managing information rather than engaging customers [2].
- **Salesforce TCO is 2-3x what it appears:** For every dollar in Salesforce licenses, another dollar goes toward add-ons, integrations, AppExchange apps, and support. Premium support plans add 20-30% to net license fees. Over 3-5 years, total implementation spend typically reaches 2-3x the original project cost [7].
- **Data quality degrades fast without intervention:** Up to 70% of CRM records become inaccurate within a year, and 10-25% of B2B database contacts contain errors at any given time [8]. Migrating dirty data is the #1 cause of migration failure, with 70% of migration failures traced to skipping data cleanup [8].

### Key Metaphors or Frameworks

**The House Move Metaphor**

A CRM migration is like moving houses. You don't just throw everything from the old house into the new one -- you sort, declutter, and organize as you pack. Some furniture fits the new layout; some needs to go. And the single biggest mistake is moving boxes of junk you haven't opened in years. Use this with clients who want to "replicate everything exactly." Challenge them: "Would you move a broken couch just because it was in your old living room?"

**When NOT to use it:** When the client has a genuinely complex Salesforce setup with critical custom objects. The metaphor can trivialize the effort. Switch to the "infrastructure rewiring" framing instead -- "This is like rewiring a building's electrical system. You need to keep the lights on during the transition."

### Target Motion

This project is designed for **Sales-Led Growth (SLG)** and **hybrid SLG/inbound-led** motions where:

- Marketing generates inbound leads via HubSpot Marketing Hub
- Sales works deals in a CRM (currently Salesforce)
- The disconnect between these two systems creates attribution gaps and data silos

Also fits companies transitioning from pure outbound to a blended inbound + outbound model, where having marketing and sales on the same platform is a prerequisite.

*Not a fit for:*
- Companies that need Salesforce-specific features (CPQ with complex pricing, advanced territory management at enterprise scale, or deep AppExchange vertical solutions)
- Organizations with 500+ Salesforce users and heavy Apex/Lightning customization -- migration complexity may exceed ROI
- Companies running Salesforce as part of a broader Salesforce ecosystem (Tableau CRM, Mulesoft, Marketing Cloud) where HubSpot cannot replace the full stack

## 2) Tools & Systems

### Primary Tools

**Salesforce (Source System)**

The system being migrated away from. Requires admin access for data export, workflow audit, and integration inventory. API access needed for automated data extraction of large datasets.

**HubSpot CRM (Target System)**

The destination platform. Requires Enterprise-tier licenses for Sales Hub (custom objects, advanced workflows), Marketing Hub (if marketing is also consolidating), and potentially Operations Hub (for complex workflow logic that mirrors Salesforce Process Builder capabilities).

**Data Migration Tools**

- **HubSpot Import Tool** -- native CSV import for standard and custom objects. Handles contact, company, deal, and ticket imports with association mapping.
- **Trujay / Import2** -- third-party migration platforms that automate Salesforce-to-HubSpot field mapping and transfer. Useful for large datasets (100K+ records) where manual CSV export/import is impractical.
- **HubSpot Operations Hub** -- required for complex data transformations, custom coded workflows, and data sync rules that go beyond standard workflow logic.

**Data Cleanup Tools:**

- **Cloudingo** -- Salesforce-native deduplication and data cleanup. Run before migration to reduce dirty data in the source system.
- **Insycle** -- HubSpot-native data management for post-migration cleanup, ongoing dedup, and data quality monitoring.
- **RingLead (now ZoomInfo)** -- for lead-to-account matching and deduplication at scale.

**Data Providers (if applicable):**

- Contact enrichment post-migration: ZoomInfo, Apollo, Clearbit (to fill gaps identified during data quality audit)
- Email validation: ZeroBounce, NeverBounce (to clean email lists before import to avoid bounces in HubSpot)

## 4) Scoping

### Scoping Factors

**1. Data Volume**

- Under 50K records -&gt; Standard HubSpot import tool, straightforward migration
- 50K-500K records -&gt; May require phased import or third-party migration tool
- 500K+ records -&gt; Requires dedicated migration platform (Trujay, Import2) and extended timeline

**2. Salesforce Customization Depth**

- Standard objects only (Accounts, Contacts, Opportunities, Leads) -&gt; Straightforward mapping
- 1-5 custom objects -&gt; Moderate complexity; requires HubSpot custom object setup
- 5+ custom objects with relationships -&gt; High complexity; may require Operations Hub and custom development

**3. Workflow and Automation Count**

- Under 20 active workflows -&gt; Can rebuild in 2-3 weeks
- 20-50 active workflows -&gt; 4-6 weeks of workflow rebuild; budget 30-40% of project time here [1]
- 50+ active workflows -&gt; Requires workflow audit to retire unused automations before rebuilding

**4. Integration Count**

- Under 5 integrations -&gt; Native HubSpot integrations likely available
- 5-10 integrations -&gt; Mix of native and custom; plan integration cutover sequence
- 10+ integrations -&gt; Dedicated integration workstream; some tools (Outreach, Salesloft) can only connect to one CRM at a time

**5. Number of User Roles/Departments**

- Single department (sales only) -&gt; Simpler training, fewer stakeholders
- 2-3 departments (sales + marketing + CS) -&gt; Cross-functional coordination needed
- 4+ departments with distinct workflows -&gt; Role-based training tracks and phased rollout recommended

**6. Historical Data Requirements**

- Last 12 months of activity -&gt; Fast, clean migration
- Last 2-3 years -&gt; Standard scope; manageable with clear cutoff rules
- Full history (5+ years) -&gt; Significant data volume; consider archiving older data outside HubSpot

**7. Migration Approach**

- Big bang (all at once) -&gt; Faster timeline but higher risk; requires confident data validation
- Phased (department by department) -&gt; Lower risk but requires managing parallel systems temporarily
- Hybrid (core data big bang, workflows phased) -&gt; Balanced approach for most mid-market companies

### Multiple Approaches

**Approach 1: Big Bang Migration**

- Criteria: Under 100K records, fewer than 20 workflows, single primary department, high executive sponsorship, tight timeline
- Execution: Full data migration in one weekend cutover window. All users switch simultaneously. Requires robust test migration and validation beforehand. 2-4 week hypercare period post-cutover.

**Approach 2: Phased Department Rollout**

- Criteria: 100K+ records, multiple departments with distinct workflows, change management concerns, lower risk tolerance
- Execution: Migrate one department at a time (typically: Marketing first since already in HubSpot, then Sales, then CS). Salesforce and HubSpot run in parallel during transition with controlled sync. Each phase has its own validation and training cycle. Total timeline: 3-5 months.

**Approach 3: Hybrid Core-First Migration**

- Criteria: Complex data model but desire for faster consolidation; strong ops team; moderate customization
- Execution: Migrate all core data (contacts, companies, deals) in a single batch. Then rebuild and test workflows in phases over 4-6 weeks while users begin operating in HubSpot for basic CRM functions. Reduces parallel-system duration while managing workflow complexity.

## 5) Discovery Questions

### Questions for Project Kickoff

**Business Context**

- What is driving the decision to migrate now? *(cost reduction, contract renewal timing, growth stage, or marketing-sales alignment)*
- What does success look like 6 months after migration is complete?
- Are there any hard deadlines? *(Salesforce contract renewal date, board reporting deadlines, new hire start dates)*

**Current Salesforce Environment**

- How many active Salesforce users do you have today, and across which departments?
- How many custom objects exist beyond standard Accounts, Contacts, Opportunities, and Leads?
- Do you have any Apex triggers, Lightning Web Components, or custom code in Salesforce?
- Which Salesforce features are most critical to your daily operations? *(CPQ, Territory Management, Einstein Analytics, etc.)*
- How many active workflows, process builder flows, and flow automations are running?

**Data Quality**

- When was the last time you ran a data cleanup or deduplication effort?
- What is your estimated duplicate rate for contacts and accounts?
- How far back does your historical data go, and how much of it is still relevant?
- Are there known data quality issues (incomplete fields, inconsistent formatting, orphaned records)?

**Integrations**

- What third-party tools are currently integrated with Salesforce? *(Outreach, Salesloft, ZoomInfo, Gong, Slack, ERP, billing, etc.)*
- Are any of these integrations bidirectional (data flows both ways)?
- Do any integrations use custom APIs or middleware (Zapier, Workato, Tray)?

**Team & Adoption**

- What is your current Salesforce adoption rate? How many users log in daily?
- What are the biggest complaints your team has about Salesforce today?
- Does anyone on your team have HubSpot experience?
- Who will be the internal champion driving adoption post-migration?

**Expectations**

- Are you expecting to replicate your current Salesforce setup exactly, or are you open to simplifying processes during the move?
- What is your budget for the migration project (including any HubSpot license upgrades)?
- Do you have internal IT resources available to support the migration, or is this fully outsourced?

### Information to Gather Before Implementation

**Salesforce Environment:**

Admin credentials and API access, complete object model export, list of all active automations (workflows, process builder, flows), inventory of third-party integrations with connection details, list of all reports and dashboards in use by department, user role and permission set documentation, any Apex code or Lightning component inventory

**HubSpot Environment:**

Super Admin access to existing HubSpot instance (if any), current HubSpot subscription tier and which Hubs are active, list of any existing HubSpot workflows, properties, or integrations that need to coexist with migrated data

**Business Requirements:**

Signed migration scope document with in/out boundaries, historical data retention requirements (cutoff date), data quality thresholds that must be met before migration proceeds, report priority list (P1/P2/P3) from each department, Salesforce contract renewal date (for license termination timing)

### Approach Decision Questions

| Question | Answer to Approach |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| How many total records across all objects? | Under 100K = Big Bang likely; 100K-500K = Hybrid; 500K+ = Phased |
| How many departments will migrate? | 1 = Big Bang; 2-3 = Hybrid or Phased; 4+ = Phased |
| Do you have Apex code or custom Lightning components? | No = Big Bang/Hybrid viable; Yes = Phased with custom dev workstream |
| What is your risk tolerance? | High = Big Bang; Medium = Hybrid; Low = Phased |
| How many active integrations? | Under 5 = Big Bang/Hybrid; 5-10 = Hybrid; 10+ = Phased |
| Is marketing already on HubSpot? | Yes = Hybrid (marketing in place, migrate sales); No = assess full scope |
| What is the Salesforce contract renewal date? | Within 3 months = Big Bang; 3-6 months = Hybrid; 6+ months = Phased |

## 6) Overcoming Common Belief Barriers

#### "We already invested so much in Salesforce -- switching would waste that investment."

Salesforce's ongoing costs compound year over year. License fees are just the starting point: premium support adds 20-30% of net license fees, AppExchange subscriptions pile up, and maintaining customizations requires dedicated admin headcount at $80K-120K/year [7]. Over a 3-year period, Salesforce TCO typically runs 2-3x the base license cost [7]. The real question is forward-looking: will the next 3 years of Salesforce spend deliver more value than migrating to a platform with 30-50% lower total cost?

**The reframe:** "The investment already happened. The question is whether you want to keep paying the maintenance tax on that investment, or redirect those dollars to a platform that costs less and drives higher adoption."

#### "Migration will break everything -- it's too risky."

Unplanned, poorly scoped migrations do fail at high rates -- 44% of businesses report migration failure when done without proper methodology [5]. But consultant-led migrations with structured planning achieve less than 10% failure rates [5]. The approach includes a dedicated test migration phase where a representative sample (1,000-5,000 records) is migrated and validated before any production data moves. A 30-90 day parallel-run period keeps Salesforce in read-only mode as a safety net. See Implementation for the full validation checkpoint framework.

**The reframe:** "The risk of a bad migration is real, which is exactly why we don't do it all at once. We test, validate, and run systems in parallel. The bigger risk is staying on a platform your team barely uses."

#### "HubSpot is for small companies -- we've outgrown it."

HubSpot Enterprise supports companies with 200+ users and complex GTM motions. The platform now includes custom objects (up to 10 per account), advanced calculated properties, multi-currency support, custom behavioral events, and Operations Hub for coded workflows [3]. The question is specific: does the client need Salesforce-specific capabilities (Apex triggers, CPQ with complex quoting rules, deep industry-specific AppExchange solutions) or are they using general CRM capabilities that HubSpot matches or exceeds?

| Capability | Salesforce | HubSpot Enterprise |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| Custom objects | Unlimited | Up to 10 (sufficient for most mid-market) |
| Workflow automation | Flow Builder (complex but steep learning curve) | Visual workflow builder (easier, less flexible for edge cases) |
| Reporting | Advanced with Einstein Analytics add-on | Native reporting + Operations Hub for custom |
| Marketing automation | Requires separate Marketing Cloud purchase | Built into Marketing Hub on same platform |
| Ease of use (G2 score) | 7.2 / 10 | 8.4 / 10 [3] |
| Average implementation time | Months (with admin/developer) | 36 days average activation [3] |

**The reframe:** "HubSpot Enterprise is not the same product as HubSpot Free. Let's map your specific requirements and see what actually needs Salesforce vs. what HubSpot handles natively."

#### "Our data is too messy to migrate."

Every migration starts with a data cleanup phase precisely because data quality is the #1 risk factor. Up to 70% of CRM records become inaccurate within a year [8], so odds are the current Salesforce data is already degraded. The migration methodology includes a dedicated data assessment step: duplicate detection, field completion analysis, stale record identification, and formatting standardization. This cleanup happens before any data moves. Post-migration, the client has cleaner data than they have today.

**The reframe:** "Your data is messy now, inside Salesforce. Migration is the forcing function that makes you actually clean it up. You'll end up in a better position than if you do nothing."

#### "We'll lose all our historical data and reporting."

Historical data migrates with the records -- activities, notes, deal amounts, close dates, and stage history all transfer. The scoping phase defines a data cutoff (typically last 2-3 years of closed deals and all open opportunities) so there is no surprise. Reports are rebuilt in HubSpot and validated against Salesforce baseline numbers. During hypercare, Salesforce stays in read-only mode for 30-90 days so any historical reference is still accessible.

**The reframe:** "Nothing gets deleted until you're confident everything is in HubSpot. We keep Salesforce available as a reference for up to 90 days after cutover."

### How to Measure Success

**Leading Indicators (Early signals, Week 1-4):**

- User login rate in HubSpot (target: 90%+ daily login within 2 weeks of go-live)
- Activity logging rate (target: 80%+ of calls, emails, and meetings logged in HubSpot)
- Support ticket volume during hypercare (declining week-over-week indicates smooth adoption)
- Data quality score post-migration (target: less than 5% duplicate rate, 95%+ completion on critical fields)
- All P1 reports validated against Salesforce baseline (target: data matches within 2% variance)

**Lagging Indicators (Proof of success, Month 2-6):**

- Total CRM spend reduction vs. Salesforce baseline (target: 30-50% reduction)
- Sales rep time savings (target: 3-5 hours/week reduction in CRM administration, measured via activity data and rep surveys)
- Marketing-to-sales attribution accuracy (target: ability to trace closed deals to originating campaign within 90 days)
- Cross-functional reporting adoption (target: department leads pulling reports directly from HubSpot without ops assistance)
- Salesforce fully decommissioned within 90 days of go-live (target: license termination submitted)
